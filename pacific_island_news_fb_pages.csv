Dr. Hsu revealed in a media conference yesterday, reports had it that China wants to offer the Solomon Islands Government a 500-million US dollars loan to finance the country's infrastructure needs. But with Solomon Islands facing a weak fiscal status, Dr. Hsu expressed concerns over how it will repay such an amount for years. ""While your country is going slowly or going down with the fiscal income and you have people proposing stepping into making another huge loan, how much was that, I heard there is a saying that the Chinese government would like to provide 500-million US dollars for our infrastructure project. How is Solomon Islands going to pay for that debt, unless your government come up with a reasonable plan even through multiple years, but you need a plan, how to pay for that debt in the long run. You have to understand there are countries in this region that have stepped into so to speak, that trap"". Meanwhile, the Taiwanese Foreign Minister said pushing oneself into the debt trap when alternatives are available is senseless. ""Also I understand that your Central Bank has also come up with a report that has not being taken into consideration saying that your country is no longer able to afford more loan, more debt. I think that's very very important so this is something that I would like to bring to your attention and I think alternatively other countries like the U.S. Australia, New Zealand and Taiwan, Japan, we have come to Solomon Islands, come up with ideas of helping you to develop infrastructure in the long run without putting you into a debt trap and that's a visible alternative path.

The association on behalf of the Chinese community then thanked the many peace-loving Solomon Islanders who have offered their support and sympathy during this difficult time. “The bravery of the RSIPF, PRT, securities, Chinese individuals and friends of the Chinese community are recognized and acknowledged. “These organisations and individuals risked their lives to protect other community members and properties from criminals, and SICA will forever be grateful for their help,” the statement said. SICA also thanked the Government for their continuous support in helping to rebuild businesses and support the Solomon Islands’ economy and also the governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea. “The support from the governments of Australia and Papua New Guinea in assisting the RSIPF to stabilise the situation and provide security is deeply appreciated,” SICA said. The association encouraged all Chinese owned and operated businesses to continue operating in an ethical and fair manner; respecting and abiding by the laws of the country. SICA said SICA and the Chinese community are confident that no matter how difficult or long it will take, they are looking forward to a brighter Solomon Islands.

Cabinet reportedly agreed on Monday this week to ban Facebook nationwide. Cabinet says it is a temporary ban in response to the many public criticism against the DCGA government and its ministers since it took office. This ban follows a growing string of unpopular actions Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare’s government has implemented following its embracement of communist China last year. In a statement yesterday, Premier Suidani said, “It should be plain and clear to the national government and the cabinet that complaints seen on Facebook is a reflection of people’s frustration towards the government. “Especially on how the government is running the affairs of the country. It is simple one cannot be his own judge. “Cabinet need not to go to Pluto or to the Moon to see why people say the things they said on social media like Facebook. “People are no longer ignorant of the issues surrounding them and they are frustrated because their concerns have not been listen to. That is the simple truth. “It is not a question of using other media plat forms but rather is the question of how do we ensure we use our responsibilities as leaders in a fairer way to help our people use these platforms more appropriately. “Transparency and accountability that we leaders have talked so much about is a two-way process and that there is no one way traffic in a democratic society. “Do not go into public life and make laws and decisions for your own good or for your own protection as is seen with the banning of Facebook. “Doing this will only lead to further frustrations. You can be guaranteed that going against your people only leads to failures. “It is time the leaders and especially the government learn to listen to our people and address the issues raised and discussed on the many local Facebook pages. “Times have change and the demand for change in leadership attitude and style is real. That is really the call for us leaders of today.”",https://www.facebook.com/theIslandSunNews/photos/a.1969037396760109/2657547257909116/?type=3,,,,,,,,579,3.53

Belden Namah today called for a closure of ports and ban on flights, passengers and cargo out of china until health authorities confirm that the Coronavirus epidemic is containable and that it is not a threat to human lives. Mr Namah said the lack of health facilities and health care professionals everywhere in PNG made it imperative that all are treated as emergencies because the chance for an infection to pass unnoticed among the population is high. “For the Health Minister, Mr Jelta Wong, to give assurances that there are no cases of infection among the population is like saying nobody has the flu”. “How does he know the virus is not here? Has he scanned every traveller into PNG from anyone of our ports of entry in the past week?” “In a situation like this, we have to adopt to a worst case scenario and reduce the alert downwards as health authorities downgrade the threat.” The leader of the opposition said PNG had too many people and business contacts with China, the origin of the virus, and it is most likely the virus could spread here as quickly as it has in Australia. “Just because nobody has been diagnosed with the virus does not mean it is not here or that the danger has passed.” He said. “It is irresponsible for the Minister for Health to give assurances when he is absolutely not in a position to do so. The borders are wide open and lack adequate government capacity for mere routine checks at any time of the year”. “For this reason, I want the border at Wutung closed until further notice. The Indonesians have taken a sensible stance and have increased health and security checks. Since we do not have the capacity to do likewise, we must close the border until further notice.” “I further call on government to close small ports to Chinese traffic and for very stringent measures to be applied at main ports to flights, ship calls, passengers and cargo out of China, regardless of cost.

Peter Kenilorea Junior has described as ""regrettable"" the cabinet's decision to establish ties with China. In a statement yesterday, Hon.

He said what is more, the decision to switch may not have benefitted from sound analysis. Mr. Kenilorea said decisions to establish and sever diplomatic ties are always going to be a sovereign decision saying, in this case, focus has always been on establishing ties with Beijing as opposed to reviewing or even deepening ties with Taiwan. He said the vote by caucus and cabinet reflected this saying, the leaders have met the deadline set by China to switch before their 70th anniversary. Meanwhile, the FRC Chair said he intends for the committee to complete its work and present its report to Parliament. He said how the government conducts its foreign policy is also part of the terms of reference for the current inquiry so the FRC's findings will still be very relevant even more so, now that a dominant China has entered the national consciousness of Solomon Islands. He adds, there are broader foreign policy issues that still needs to be examined and observed. Hon. Kenilorea said in terms of the vision for a modern democratic Solomon Islands, he feels the country may have missed an opportunity to standout from the rest and perhaps even lower the trend.

Speaking exclusively to Solomon Star Auki from Taipei, Premier Suidani said he is now feeling well after receiving the much needed medical treatment. Mr Suidani underwent his medical treatment at the National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH), after being flown from Australia towards the end of May. Information gathered stated that Premier Suidani has been ill for a few months with a provisional diagnosis pointing to a probable brain space occupying lesion, following a medical check-up in Honiara. After the medical check-up, local medical doctors referred Suidani for an urgent Head CT/MRI scan diagnosis and treatment overseas. According to medical reports, the Malaita Premier suffered a throbbing headache on the right side of his forehead, supraorbital, parietal, and temporal region. It was reported during his trip to Taiwan that Suidani’s medical case was referred to the Overseas Referral Committee (ORC) of the National Referral Hospital (NRH) in Solomon Islands on 5 March 2021 for assistance, but there was no response. Following the discovery that the Premier needs to go for medical treatment overseas, a GoFundMe account was also created online in mid-February to reach out to friends and supporters overseas through which funds were raised to aid the Premier’s medical trip. In an effort to do private fundraising to support Premier Suidani’s medical case many good hearted Malaitans and friends have given financial support to help the Premier get overseas medical treatment as soon as possible. Through this concerted effort of these friends reaching out to Taiwan, it made it possible for Taiwan to support the diagnosis and treatment. After Taiwan had offered Mr Suidani the lifesaving assistance, he thanked Taiwan for making it possible for him to seek medical treatment in one of the most advanced medical places in the world. Meanwhile, after the successful medical treatment, Premier Suidani again thanked the government of Taiwan for the lifesaving help through its humanitarian assistance. The Malaita Premier also thanked those who helped him in their prayers. “Your prayers have been answered as my health is now improved,” he told this paper. The Malaita Premier is expected to arrive back in the country in the third week of this month ahead of the Malaita Second Appointed day celebration in August next month.

But receiving the grants by the MPs comes with a catch. “They must first renounce and remove their names from the Malaita Communiqué in a public statement or they get nothing. This is a government decision, not China’s,” insiders have confirmed to Island Sun. “So the onus is on them. If they want the money it is there, but at the same time they are required to do certain things in order to access it. If they want the money it is there. If they do not want the money, it will be there all the same until they fulfill their part,” Hon Maelanga is expected to tell the MPs. It is understood that China wasted no time in filling the financial vacuum left by Taiwan when it was banished in a decision by the Solomon Islands Government to switch diplomatic relations to China last September. Constituencies that support the Government’s diplomatic move are expected to receive their share of the RCDF grants this week. According to sources Beijing has paid some $55 million or $1.1 million per Constituency into an escrow account in one of the commercial banks in Honiara in recent weeks. For purposes of accountability, the account will be jointly administered by the Solomon Islands Government and the Chinese Embassy in Honiara. The $55 million is equivalent to Taiwan’s annual contribution to the RCDF grants, which it jointly funded with the Solomon Islands Government over the years. Maintaining the RCDF grants for the next three years is one of five projects Beijing has agreed to fund. The others are the National Referral Hospital, the 2023 Pacific Games, the Upgrade of the Honiara Water system and the Upgrade of Solomon Islands National University (SINU) facilities in the capital, Honiara. Inspired by Premier Daniel Suidani, the Communiqué said in part that Constituencies on Malaita would not accept any financial assistance, including the RCDF grants from China. The six MPs, including Opposition Leader and MP for Aoke/Langa Langa, Matthew Wale, Small Malaita MP and former Prime Minister Ricky Houenipwela and other have signed the Communiqué, which also said Malaita would look to the United States of America, Japan and Australia to assist in its development endeavors. Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Infrastructure Development (MID) Maelanga is believed to have been authorised by Government Caucus to dangle the “carrot” before the six Malaitan MPs and their constituencies. “It will be up to the MPs to decide,” the sources said. Hon Maelanga did not return calls by Island Sun over the weekend.",,,,,,,,,512,5.57

Speaking to senior journalists on Wednesday Ming is very worried that this travel restriction has caused a lot of setbacks for them. “We really need our diplomat officials to travel to Honiara so that we can resume official activities with the Solomon Islands Government,” Ming said. When asked if Ming has already spoken to the SIG Officials, he confirmed that he has already met with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and External Trade. “Yes, I have met with the minister and his permanent secretary (PS) and I also met with the responsible officials within the Office of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (OPMC). “In fact I raised our concern with the OPMC Chief of Staff in several occasions to ease the travel ban for our diplomatic officials,” Ming told the journalists.

Australian born Solomon Islander Rhiannon Quan is the newly crowned Miss Solomon Islands for Bodybuilding flagged by the Solomon Islands National Bodybuilding Federation (SINBBF) during its 2020 national competition last weekend at Pacific Casino Hotel in Honiara. The 22 year old was drawn to bodybuilding to be a better version of her, and she said that's what drove her to keep going with it after her first competition. Born from a well-established prominent family business here in the country, QQQ Wholesale. Rhiannon’s father a Chinese born here in Solomon Islands and her mother part Malaitian and Gilbertese percentage are one of the founding businesses in Honiara since the ’80s till today. She begins her early education at the Woodford International School from kindergarten to Grade 3 before moving to the land down under for further studies. “I usually return home (Solomon Islands) on holidays mostly working with the family’s business,” says Rhiannon. She graduated from Year 12 in Australia and undergoes a year to study Mandarin in Shanghai, China. “After that, I saw that my father needed help with the family business so it prompts me to return home and help him.” It was in August she found interest in going to the gym to take up a new challenge for herself representing the Pacific Flex Gym at the Pacific Casino hotel. “I started to get serious about going to the gym in August this year, I went every day. Since the covid 19 pandemics and having mostly nothing to do I wanted to challenge and push myself in fitness rather than just staying at home” she says. “I began to take my new hobby seriously when I met the SINBBF athletes and they encouraged me to compete. And I also saw that like there are not many females involved so I said to myself I can join and encourage more women and girls to join a male dominated sport.” “And then I met two other ladies who are also apart of SINBBF, they are so nice, we all like talking to each other and that’s when my interest grew."" Rhiannon competed and won in the Bikini and Physique category where female athletes get to be identified for the proportion in muscular size with the maximum amount of leanness. “I was just giving a shot at it,” she said. “I was so surprised, I just started but I’m just really happy that I won. And I want to encourage more girls into the sport.” Next for Rhiannon, she wants to continue from what she does and improving it as a role model for others in her gender. “I realized I wanted to own my appearance, my hard-earned muscles, and celebrate them. That belonged to me. I felt good about being a part of a community that applauded and encouraged the work that went into it. “Body Building is an ongoing process, there is always room for improvement, and therefore I want to focus on improving my body more. I’ll be looking forward to next year’s competition to see if I can retain the title. Maybe there’ll be more women and girls to compete in the competition next year so it will be more exciting, something new!” she says. Rhiannon also expresses her excitement to work closely with SINBBF supporting athletes in their preparation build-up towards the 2023 Pacific Games. “I want to get more females aware, that anyone, any girl can do it and by also making history if more females represent the Solomon Islands. I’m hoping to compete and yes with others too. ""I'd love to get up on stage again,” she expresses. “No pain no gain, have a strong mind even if you feel down at least you do what you have to do and your hard work will pay off and it will show for everyone to see.” ""If you've got the patience and time, it can be a wonderful sport with a large community of people."" She’s the second born in her family of having an elder brother who currently on studies overseas.",https://www.facebook.com/theIslandSunNews/photos/a.1969037396760109/2677608032569705/?type=3,https://www.facebook.com/login/?next=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FtheIslandSunNews%2Fphotos%2Fa.1969037396760109%2F2677608032569705%2F%3Ftype%3D3,,Photos from The Island Sun News's post,,,,,467,2.85

Australia asks Sogavare not to sign China security treaty BY MAVIS N. PODOKOLO AUSTRALIA yesterday asked Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare not to sign the controversial security treaty he’s negotiating with China. Its Minister for International Development and the Pacific, Zed Seselja, relayed the request when he met Sogavare in Honiara. Seselia flew into Honiara on Tuesday specifically to meet and relay Canberra’s request to Sogavare. “I met Sogavare, his deputy and a number of other ministers,” Seselia said in a statement issued after the meeting. “We have asked Solomon Islands respectfully to consider not signing the agreement and to consult the Pacific family in the spirit of regional openness and transparency, consistent with our region’s security frameworks,” he added. “Australia will always support our Pacific family. “Our view remains firmly that the Pacific family will always meet the security needs of our region. “We are proud that SIAF responded swiftly and effectively to restore calm in Honiara following civil unrest in November 2021, at Solomon Islands’ request, and under the direction of the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force.” It’s not clear last night what Sogavare’s response would be. Foreign Affairs permanent secretary Colin Beck told reporters yesterday government would issue a statement on Seselia’s meeting with Sogavare later. Seselia’s trip here comes ahead of a similar meeting the United States is intending to have with Sogavare later this month. Washington has announced it is dispatching its top Asia official, Kurt Campbell, later this month to Honiara to discuss the China security deal. Although Sogavare had said earlier the proposed security treaty does not cater for the construction of a Chinese military base, the West is not convinced. It’s expected the US will deliver the same message to Sogavare. Meanwhile, Seselia said Canberraa welcomes recent statements from Sogavare that Australia remains Solomon Islands security partner of choice, and his commitment that Solomon Islands will never be used for military bases or other military institutions of foreign powers. “We look forward to ongoing engagement with the Solomon Islands Government, and with our Pacific family members, on these very important issues. “Australia’s commitment to working with Solomon Islands on its security needs is to do so swiftly, transparently and with full respect for its sovereignty. “Australia will continue supporting peace, prosperity, stability and our shared democratic values in Solomon Islands and across the region.”",https://www.facebook.com/theIslandSunNews/photos/a.1969037396760109/3019131681750670/?type=3,,,,,,,,437,2.66

Whether it was considered, we do know. “Because of the swearing is why we people of Choiseul Province gave an earlier demand for the national government to must compensate us because we the people are innocent and such treatment towards us also hurts us. “With three points, if the national government does not meet our demand, the Prime Minister must step down, secondly, in any national event Choiseul Province will not take part to show that we are not happy about this issue. Third, having the borders now closed, with the government not considering our cost, we will not take serious of the border closure, meaning we will only open our border. “These are three points on which the Choiseul Provincial Government will still come out more with on the media. “To this date we do know of what happened to our request so we now demand the national government to fulfil their promise for giving $3million compensation to Choiseul Province. “The Prime Minister and national government have only been quiet on this issue on which this is an important point that we raise for the national government to address.”",,,,,,,,,428,4.65

A White House statement released shortly after the visit said, Washington would have “significant concerns and respond accordingly” to any steps to establish a permanent Chinese military presence in Solomon Islands. But the Chinese Embassy in a statement today stated they ‘object to any third party’s intention to interfere with security cooperation between China and Solomon Islands as sovereign states.’ “During its visit to Solomon Islands, the U.S. delegation openly warned the Solomon Islands government over the security cooperation between China and Solomon Islands, which had once again exposed some countries’ condescending acts in disrespect to other nations. “In accordance with the principles of on equal footing, mutual respect and non-interference into each other's internal affairs, the cooperation in security and other fields between China and Solomon Islands conforms to international law and norms and is conducive to regional stability and development,” the statement says. It adds, both China and Solomon Islands have repeatedly emphasized that reports on so-called Chinese military base in Solomon Islands are misinformation fabricated by those people with ulterior motives. “Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Solomon Islands, the exchanges and cooperation between two countries in various fields have yielded fruitful results and been warmly welcomed by two peoples. “Any attempt to inflame the situation, provoke tensions and stir up confrontation in the Pacific Islands region does not serve common interest of regional countries and is doomed to fail,” it says.",https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=371692744970419&set=a.312578104215217&type=3,,,,,,,,425,1.31

During the medical trip, an MRI test was carried out on the suspected brain space-occupying lesion that was suspected by doctors at the National Referral Hospital (NRH) in Honiara. The NRH doctors then referred the premier to seek further diagnosis overseas on the suspected conditions since there is no CT scan or MRI machines in the country to carry out check and treatment for the Malaita Premier.

Lilo signals the warning after leaked documents show the Minister of Finance and Treasury, Harry Kuma was in discussion for possible loan through middle man or broker Terry Wong in Beijing. According to Australia Broadcasting Cooperation (ABC), in one of the letters Kuma accepts in principle a proposed 11 per cent brokerage fee — amounting to $92 billion SBD (US$11 billion). Solomon Islands has a gross domestic product (GDP) of $10 billion SBD ($US1.3 billion). Lilo, also the former Under Secretary to budget, Permanent secretary and two times Finance minister, said this borrowing will create heavily indebtedness, economy overheating and inflation for the country. He said Solomon Islands has a small population, land issues to invite more investors and structural problems. “You compare $10 billion GDP to $800 billion loan. Is this a realistic amount you need?” he asked. “Remember you are talking about half a million people. “Our domestic capacity to repay it is based on tax which is very small,” he said. Lilo said the action of the government is like putting a six horse power on a barge. “Can you tell me that motor will survive? “When it reaches 50 meters, the whole propeller will smash,” he said. As such, Lilo said when you pour more liquidity in the economy; you are heating up the economy. “Don’t dream about some kind of windfall revenues or treasures to re-heat the economy. “What supply side of the economy will absorb that?” he asked. Lilo said take the $800 billion and amortized it. Amortize is to gradually write off the initial cost of (an asset) over a period. “For example, the repayment period is the minimum of 10 years and maximum of 20 years. “In 20 years, repayment will be $50 billion. If 10 years, it will be $100 billion,” he said. Lilo believed it can result in 56% of GDP on repayment which surpasses the 30% threshold of debt. He said this is just a raw figure. “Ask the CBSI to use IMF format. “If China or USA borrow such amount, they are capable to repay the loan because of their domestic strength,” he said. Lilo is currently awaiting his decision on the Petition case against Member of Parliament for Gizo Kolombangara, Lanelle Tanangada. It is likely to be heard in two weeks’ time.

President Tsai said all technical and medical mission personnel stationed in the country are being recalled immediately. She thanks all Taiwan Government personnel in the country for fighting bravely to save our diplomatic relationship. President Tsai said, it is indeed regrettable that a number of unfinished cooperative projects must come to an end, and it is a loss for Solomon Islands people. She said this is the choice that Solomon Islands' government has made, leaving Taiwan with no other option but to respond in this way. Taiwan strongly condemns the Solomon Islands government's decision to establish diplomatic relations with China. Over the past few years, China has continually used financial and political pressure to suppress Taiwan's international space, said President Tsai. She said, in the face of China's interference and suppression, Taiwan will not stand to be threatened, nor will we be subjected to ceaseless demands. Meanwhile, the Solomon Islands Embassy in Taipei has issued a statement to the Solomon Islands students studying in various universities in Taiwan, calling for a meeting with the executive committee members of the student body tomorrow. His Excellency Joseph Waleanisia said the discussion will be on the implications of the Government decision and what to do next. His Excellency Waleanisia will put out further notice to all students later today after consultations with Honiara and further instructions from ROC's Ministry of Finance.

Still in its design stage, this plan, once successful, will enable all Solomon Islanders in the country access to internet services. While the national government is tight lipped about this project, consultations have taken place between different government officials and a Huawei representative in Honiara. The Minister for Communication and Aviation, Peter Shanel Agovaka, confirmed that he had set up a technical team to work with a Huawei representative with the view to advise his Ministry and Cabinet on the matter. Agovaka has been instrumental in pushing forward Solomon Islands fibre-optic backbone, and his vision is to implement a country-wide infrastructure roll out to bring faster broadband to rural areas. “After taking office I embarked on a policy of getting a fibre-optic cable for the country,” the Minister said. “The next phase of my plan is to connect the rural communities with internet and to do so means we must have broadband towers. ""The third phase is to have the provinces that have no optic fibre cable connected.” The Minister said that whatever plans the government has, and how it decides to implement such plans is a sovereign decision. Huawei, once removed from a contract in Solomon Islands, is most likely approached by the government to build the 200-telecommunication towers while China is the most likely financier for this project. Details on this project are still sketchy but it is said that the government is keen to pursue this initiative with China. It is understood the 200-telecommunication towers report has not yet reached Cabinet level. Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd is a Chinese multinational technology company and a world-leading telecommunications provider with $USD 109 billion in annual sales. The founder and CEO of Shenzhen-based Huawei, Ren Zhengfei, is a former Chinese military officer. The U.S. government actively discourages U.S. carriers from buying Huawei telecom equipment because of security concerns. Google recently restricted Huawei's access to its Android operating system and apps after the Trump administration blacklisted the firm. Huawei is also banned from bidding or building 5G networks in Britain, France, Germany, and Australia because of similar security concerns. In the Pacific region, Papua New Guinea’s Communications Minister has insisted that his country should not repay a $US53 million loan to China, money that was used to build a national data centre. A report obtained by the Financial Review found that the PNG data centre, designed and built with Huawei equipment, exposed secret government files to being stolen. The report stated that data flows could be easily intercepted without detection. China’s foreign affairs official, Zhao Lijan, in a recent press conference, told theGlobe and Mail that the Ministry is not aware of the report. He insists that the Chinese government requires all Chinese enterprises operating overseas to abide by local laws and regulations. The data centre has not been operational as it quickly fell into disrepair as insufficient money was set aside for operations. The data centre was part of an Integrated Government Information System (IGIS), which planned to link 57 sites in Port Moresby and five regional centres. It was meant to store confidential government information and the entire data archive of the PNG government. By Georgina Kekea",,,,,,,,,390,4.24

Speaking in Parliament during the debate on the extension of the public emergency for another four months on Monday, Kenilorea referred to the need to learn from other successful countries that have, so far, kept the covid-19 virus at bay. He said two of these successful countries are Taiwan and Singapore. “They are island nations which make them great models for island countries like Solomon Islands to emulate. “In fact the world can learn from these success stories,” he said. Kenilorea said while much needs to be understood about covid-19, Taiwan continues to lead the world showing how this pandemic could be handled. “Acting early, fast, using technology, and a united people placing trust in their authorities are some of the ingredients for success. “While Solomon Islands may not be receiving any masks or support from Taiwan now, I still stand with pride in the knowledge that our old friends are helping other friends globally, despite their lack of political recognition around the world. “After all, we are all human facing a common global threat. Thank you, Taiwan,” he said. Solomon Islands established diplomatic relations with the Republic of China (Taiwan) from 24 March 1983 with resident diplomatic missions in both respective capitals.

The nine contractors started work on Monday and expected to complete it by today on all nine dormitories including the girls’ hostel. Ministry of Infrastructure Development selected the contractors due to the threat of the coronavirus (COVID-19) which has confirmed cases in neighbouring countries like Fiji and Papua New Guinea. Solomon Islands is still to record a single case since the virus was discovered in Wuhan, Hubei province in China last December. Island Sun visited KGVI yesterday and saw the contractors including men and woman busy painting, removing windows, cleaning the ablution blocks and changing nets of the rooms. LPS Contractor Managing Director Luciano said they worked 24 hours in order to complete the work in time. He said all the work should be complete by today. About $2.3 million was allocated for the maintenance work at KGVI which will be shared among the nine contractors. As such, one contractor should receive about $250,000. There are more than 100 rooms at KGVI which can accommodate up to 200 people for the 14 days quarantine period. MID officers were stationed at KGVI to witness the maintenance to make sure it is completed on time. It is understood KGVI will start hosting incoming passengers by Friday this week. One of the MID officers said KGVI, GBR at Honiara International Airport and Telekom hostel are the three sites for quarantine. Island Sun also visited GBR and found out that people are already been quarantined in the site. Media is not allowed to enter the premise of the GBR. In the meantime, Governor General Sir David Vunagi has declared a State of Emergency yesterday to allow the government to impose rules for citizens to follow during this pandemic situation.

Hou for publicly admitting that he was responsible for the release of the unsanctioned media statement on behalf of the 16 Ministers and MPs which Coalition Parties condemned as being in direct breach of Cabinet protocols by taking a stand before any reports were submitted.

The signing of the letter of exchange took place on the margins of the 51st Pacific Islands Forum Leaders meeting in Suva, Fiji, last night. The signing means the two countries will now secure the rights and responsibilities over their marine resources and exert maritime claims as Parties to the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention. Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said the signing signifies a celebration of the rolling out of the Ocean chapter of the draft 2050 Strategy while continuing to invest in the sovereignty and sovereign rights of our people over our maritime zones. “This signing signifies our commitment to the 1982 United Nations Law of the Sea Convention which Solomon Islands and Fiji are both parties to. “Itself is one of the achievements the Pacific region is, and in shaping the international convention as we celebrated the 50th Anniversary of the Pacific Islands Forum,” Prime Minister Sogavare said. Prime Minister of the Republic of Fiji Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama said signing of the agreement is an important milestone. “Mapping ocean boundaries is a determinative challenge for us large ocean states in the Pacific, implementing regional ocean solutions depend on such agreements. “They are the foundation of the great blue Pacific wall of sustainably-managed ocean space we are looking to build,” Prime Minister Bainimarama said. Bainimarama said the signing of the agreement is an important milestone to demarcate the region’s 48 shared maritime boundaries, of which remain to be finalised through an agreement. In 2018, PIF forum leaders acknowledged the urgency and importance of securing the region’s maritime boundaries as a key issue for the development and security of the region, and thereby for the security and well-being of the Blue Pacific. Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare also attended the Group of the African Caribbean Pacific Leaders’ (PACP) Meeting yesterday. The PIF Secretary General Henry Puna said one of the key issues which will be unpacked this week is the 2050 Strategy for “our” Blue Pacific Continent. The 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent is a regional strategy to protect and secure Pacific people, place and prospects. This is the first face-to-face meeting of the PIF leaders since the start of the pandemic. Other issues that are on the discussion table this week include climate change, healing the Micronesian rift, Pacific partnerships with China, Ocean and fisheries issues and nuclear policy.

He said many people are returning home due to the COVID-19 threat and put more pressure on these vulnerable communities forcing them to dig deeper into their pockets just to put a single meal on the table to sustain their lives.

As a matter of fact when the media report on the matter came out we did a search of the address in Beijing the individual provided and it was found it is not a company premises. “It seems that it is an apartment, which the individual might be using for his own business,” the Chinese government official said. The news of the reported $100 billion loan emanated from leaked letters, allegedly written and signed off by Finance Minister Harry Kuma to a Terry Wong in Beijing. In the first letter, dated 27 November 2019, Mr. Kuma wrote: “I have been advised by your representative in the Solomon Islands in respect to the potential funding that could be made available to the Solomon Islands government. My Ministry is interested in officially opening dialogue to investigate this proposal further in detail based on the information that was provided to me at the initial briefing, “I encourage you to provide further detailed information regarding this funding proposal so that my Ministry and I can have a better understanding of what is being tabled, and be able to make a fair judgment. “Note that we are very interested in any potential funding that would contribute to the improvement of our economy and the betterment of our people,” the letter addressed to a Mr. Terry Wong said. The second letter the next day (28 November 2019) disclosed an 11 per cent brokerage fee which Mr. Kuma said “is noted and accepted in principle.” In today’s exchange rate, 11 per cent of $100 billion is USD11 billion, which is equivalent to SBD91.85 billion (1USD = SBD8.35). That disclosure touched off a flurry of activities in Honiara in the past week, prompting the Opposition’s call on the Government to provide details. Former Prime Minister Gordon Darcy Lilo also bought into the debate, demanding answers from the Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare-led government on the loan negotiations. Others are also questioning why dealings between two sovereign states as is the case between Solomon Islands and the PRC should be conducted through a third party. “It would have been acceptable if we did not have diplomatic relations with China. But we do,” one critic said. “Now the onus is on the Minister of Finance to explain his action to the nation, given that Honiara and Beijing normalized diplomatic relations in September last year. His letters to Terry Wong came two months after the fact or does he not know about the change in diplomatic relations?”",,,,,,,,,150,1.63

Now Government says the proposed flight to China is aimed at giving back the so-called stranded Solomon Islands nationals in China their constitutional rights. Speaking at a public forum on Friday last week, Dr Jimmie Rodgers, Secretary to the Prime Minister, gave this response to a question on “Why China?” “The reason to going there is to give them their constitutional rights,” said Mr Rodgers. “China is guilty of where virus has started from, [but] right now China is one of the safest countries. The risk now is Philippines. This country is 100 times riskier than China. “So why China? The questioned is why Philippines we have 53 nationals in China are waiting repatriation so this why we are looking at making sure that they are repatriated and every country 750 will be coming back and 53 in China have the same constitutional right as you and I for the government’s protection “I will say this because I have been hit hard on why China, let’s be very clear we assessed the risk and any one coming in from any country has to have a clear assessment on health and any one boarding the plane must have negative test whether its China , Indonesia, UK or Australia or wherever no exception no one steps in the Plane unless they fulfill our procedures,” said Rodgers. This fresh excuse, coupled with their previous claim that it is much safer in China than anywhere else our citizens are stranded in, Government says justifies the proposed China-flight. This latest ‘reason’ only adds salt to wound on students stranded in the Philippines and their families who have been pleading with government since the early months of covid-19’s wake for their repatriation. Government has since then been unenthusiastic in answering their calls, only recently announcing that some plans are in the pipeline for their repatriation. [Yesterday, government announced during the weekly radio talkback show that repatriation flights have been arranged for students in the Philippines for September 15, 18 and October 22].

The Prime Minister left for his home village in Kumanibai in East Choiseul, Choiseul Province yesterday. Prior to his departure, PM Sogavare had engaged in two important occasions namely the dedication of the Seventh Day Adventist Church at Sukiki, East Guadalcanal and paying final respect to the country’s ambassador to the Peoples’ Republic of China (PRC) the late John Moffat Fugui. It is customary of Prime Ministers to take a break from national duty but not for the usual 28 days as applied to public servants. Given the importance of ensuring leadership continuity, PMs often take shorter breaks and PM Sogavare is no different. During his absence the Deputy Prime Minister Hon. Manasseh Maelanga will be the supervising Prime Minister.

He said the COVID-19 global pandemic that began in Wuhan, China some 7 months ago has been an awakening call for the country. He said Solomon Islands is undeniably blessed to be amongst the very few countries in the world that is still COVID-19 free. “And for that we are forever grateful to our Father in Heaven,” he said. Prime Minister Sogavare said our status as a COVID-19 free country is also a testament of our unity as one people, one nation, one Solomon Islands. “This global pandemic has truly tested our resolve but we have stood our ground, and we will continue to move forward together as a country. This pandemic has indeed changed the global, political, social and economic landscape and we as a country have not escaped this change,” he said. The Prime Minister said our conventional way of doing things is no longer effective. He said the pandemic has taught us that we really need to explore ways of doing things differently. “Doing things the normal way is no longer normal. These are challenging times but with these challenges comes opportunity,” he said. The launching yesterday was also graced with a unity song sang by our local artists and musicians. Prime Minister Sogavare also acknowledged the musicians that have worked tirelessly in putting the song together. “Music is the universal language of the soul and it speaks to everyone from the mountains of Malaita to the shores of Western Province. From the beaches of Temotu to the jungles of Guadalcanal. It is common in all our cultures throughout all our provinces and it inspires and motivates,” he said. The event was also attended by government ministers, senior government officials, diplomatic reps, private sector reps, civil society reps, Church leaders and members of the public. --OPMC 1.

BY SAMIE WAIKORI Auki The Malaita provincial government is concerned with Malaitan members of Parliament bringing in Chinese to engage in development in the province. The limelight has been shed on the MPs for Baegu Asifola (BAC) and Fataleka constituencies. Underlying this concern is the Auki Communique, which rejects and Chinese investment in the province. Advisor to the Malaitan Premier, Celsius Talifilu made a public statement questioning these two MPs. “Many of us by now would have heard that the MPs for BAC and Fataleka have brought in some Chinese nationals for the development of the much talked about road from Fouia to Manu. “This is despite the call by premier of Malaita province for national leaders to respect the Auki communiqué and leave out any engagement with any affiliates of the Chinese Communist party into malaita province. “Such show of behavior by the two leaders has shown the disregard to a call by an elected government of Malaita province. “I know for sure the two MPs are well aware that myself and the premier are from Baegu and Fataleka as well as a both of us are instrumental in putting together this communiqué. “I would have thought that as people from the same language groups and who is blood related, a courtesy to honour the views and the stand of Malaita province would be something respectful,” he said. Talifilu said he has been informed by the people that the two MPs have directly denounced the stand the Malaita province has taken. In this regard, he said the Malaita province will continue to speak against any developments from CCP affiliates, and will use all possible means under the powers of the provincial government to deal with such developments and behaviors of national leaders. “As I said before, the Malaita provincial government continues to support the national government initiative under the National Transport Core Initiative that see donor partners other than PRC developments the road infrastructure of Malaita province including the Fouia Manu segment. “We failed to see why the two MPs have seeing it fit and gone ahead to bring in China into the picture knowing very well that Malaita province is against any development from China into Malaita province. “We neither see the current engagement of the two MPs with the Chinese nor did different from the current action by the government that threatened to dissolve MPG. “Under such threats to the good will of Malaita province to protect its province, the province will not be taking these threats lightly. “The province will not back down from what it sees as threat that perpetuated with the aim of destabilizing the MARA government,” Talifilu said.",https://www.facebook.com/theIslandSunNews/photos/a.1969037396760109/2999764007020771/?type=3,,,,,,,,270,1.65

This is according to senior member of the Government’s Oversight Committee, on the covid-19. Speaking during a talkback show over the weekend, Chief of Staff of the Prime Minister’s Office Mr Robson Djokovic said the Government began taking proactive measures to address the potential entry or spread of covid-19 into the country two months ago. The Oversight Committee confirmed other bilateral, multilateral and donor partners have pledged their support to assist Government in providing the much-needed PPEs and testing kits and Laboratory equipment. Some of the supplies are arriving in the country before the second week of April. Yesterday afternoon the Oversight Committee heard the first shipment of orders from the People’s Republic of China are on route via DHL. Secretary to Prime Minister Dr Jimmie Rogers updated, as soon as the batch gets to Brisbane, our Plane will transport them to the country. ‘Maybe by mid this week, we will have new stocks coming in because current limited stocks will not spread too far’, he underlined. There is a second arrangement he added. This is also from the People’s Republic of China coming through French Polynesia. This will most likely be dropped off in Fiji and our national airline will airlift it from there. The Committee is hopeful that by the end of this week, both supplies will be in the country. The Committee reiterated whilst most entry into other countries is restricted, Government is working closely with its bilateral and development partners to ensure the efficient delivery of these supplies. Although flights are currently suspended to limit the entry of passengers into the country, emergencies, refuelling and cargo carriers are permitted. Meanwhile, Government acknowledges the Australian High Commission’s donation of a batch of Personal Hygiene kits to the National Disaster Operation Centre yesterday. The kits contain sanitary items such as Toilet Tissues, Shaving Gear, Soap, Cleaning detergent, Colgate and Tooth Brush, Face mask and Gloves. The Democratic Coalition Government (DCGA) continues to commend the cooperation of bilateral, multilateral and donor partners for their support. The DCGA encourages all citizens to strictly follow the advice and instructions of the Government and its agencies so we can remain united in our efforts to defend against the covid-19 global pandemic. --OPMC PRESS",,,,,,,,,264,2.87

A RECENT opinion poll undertaken in Honiara following last November’s riots found more Solomon Islanders wanted the country to be diplomatically aligned with liberal democratic countries. APMI Partners, Asia Pacific region's leading provider of market research, social research, economic research, fieldwork services and market-intelligence based consulting, carried out the research. This is to determine the view of the adult population relating to issues such as which countries the Solomon Islands should be diplomatically aligned towards, which countries the Solomon Islands should receive financial aid from, the level of foreign investment in key industries such as forestry and the level of perceived government corruption. One question asked “Do you prefer the Solomon Islands to be diplomatically aligned more towards China or liberal democratic counties?” The overwhelming majority of 91% answered “Liberal Democratic Countries” with only 9% answering “China”. In another question, asked “Should the Solomon Islands receive financial aid from China?” 79% answered “No” and 21% answered “Yes”. In terms of the level of perceived government corruption, one question asked “Do you believe that there exists corruption in the national government?” where 83% answered “Yes”. A subsequent question asked “Over the last 12 months, do you believe that the level of corruption in the national government has decreased, remained the same or increased?” where 68% answered “Increased”; 21% answered “Remained the Same” and 11% answered “Decreased”. The survey used a methodology where a nationwide, representative survey of 1,526 adults throughout the nine provinces of the Solomon Islands was conducted between 25th November to 7th December 2021.",https://www.facebook.com/theIslandSunNews/photos/a.1969037396760109/3022737234723448/?type=3,,,,,,,,261,1.59

Philippines is “high risk” for covid-19 infections. The change in the flight schedules was needed to give ample time for our health officials and the taskforce established by the OSC to liaise with Philippines Red Cross to coordinate changes to the passenger list for the first flight. “Timing for the second and third flights will be confirmed by the Oversight Steering Committee in due course,” the NDC statement said. “The returning students will be accommodated at government managed Quarantine Stations (QS) at Guadalcanal Beach Resort and Chengs Building both located in East Honiara,” it added. “This 1st Philippine repatriation flight will be the 12th flight the Solomon Airlines will do. “Of the previous 11 flights, six were from Brisbane, two from Vila and Nadi, one from Auckland, one from Guangzhou, China and one from Apia, Samoa. “Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS) continues to lead the Government’s multi-sectoral approach to stem covid-19 infiltration on our shores. “All government agencies and stakeholders are providing the required support through the National Disaster Operations Committees (N-DOC) and Provincial Disaster Operations Committee (P-DOC). “N-DOC Camp Management Sector Committee maintains and continues to manage all the government approved QS in Honiara and Western province.” At the moment, only 36 persons are undergoing quarantine at the government-managed quarantine sites.

According to MFET website, the ministry is responsible for implementing the Enhanced Integrated Framework (EIF) Programme in Solomon Islands. EIF is a multi-donor programme, which supports Least Development Countries (LDC) to be more active players in the global trading system, by helping them tackle their supply side constraint to trade. The EIF national Implementation Unit (NIU based at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and External Trade (MFAET) is responsible for the implementation of the EIF programme/ projects in Solomon Islands. The EIF NIU is currently implementing two (2) EIF supported projects, known as the EIF Tier 1 and Tier 2 projects. The Tier 1 project is on strengthening of national institutional capacities related to Trade while the Tier 2 project is on supporting / helping LDCs integrate better into the global trading system in a way which contributes to poverty reduction and sustainable development. Our recently approved Tier 2 project (ECAT) which aims to expand economic and employment opportunities through systematic interventions in selected agriculture value chains and associated trade and promotion activities is under implementation. Last week the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock has signed an SBD$2.7 Million funding agreement with the management of SAPE Farm representative Dr. Paul Bosawai Popora to further support the farm into mass commercial production of Cassava and Potato. The SAPE farm is base in Guadalcanal Plains in North Guadalcanal.

Before the China-direct flight, Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare and his government communications released a lot of strong statements emphasising the urgency and reasons why repatriation of our citizens [in China and Philippines] is a must. However, yesterday, five days after the infamous China-direct flight landed in Honiara, in his nation-wide address PM Sogavare says the dates for the Philippine flights “are not final and can change”. This sudden change in tone has sparked worry among parents and concerned citizens. Sogavare said, in his statement, said: “Fellow citizens, as you might have been informed already, the next two repatriation flights will be from Manila, Philippines. “They are scheduled for 15th and 18th September 2020. However, as you, all know there are so many moving parts to planning an operation such as repatriation flights and as such, these dates are not final and can be changed.” Concerned parents share that government, after the China-direct flight, is suddenly bringing back to the forefront the issue of risk levels in the two countries [China and the Philippines], something which government had used earlier this year to explain why it has not rushed to repatriate our students when covid-19 began soaring in the Philippines. In his address yesterday, Sogavare said: “Unlike China, which the risk level is in category 3, Philippines is in category 4 and more riskier. “However, as a responsible Government, it is our obligation to repatriate our stranded students in the Philippines as keeping them there longer will increase their chances of contracting the virus. “Therefore, despite the risks, we must bring our students home and we are expecting to repatriate well over 400 of our students. “The Ministries of Education, Foreign Affairs and Health are coordinating the testing arrangements with the assistance from the World Health Organization for our students. “We will continue to keep our people informed of these two repatriation flights.”",,,,,,,,,253,2.75

Zhong who appeared from extended court bail of K10, 000 was charged under the Customs Act in January and had pleaded guilty when his charges were read out. The court found out that consignment note on the 24-foot container that contained the 148 cartons of cigarettes was falsely declared as plastic rakes and toilet tissues. Senior District Court Magistrate, Cosmar Bidar said the state losses large revenues through the import of illicit cigarettes and said Asians doing business in PNG must respect the PNG Laws.

Members of Solomon Islands Students Association at Philippines (SISAP) said why they have this fear is because of the Covid-19 environment exposure they are in from a high risk country as Philippines. SISAP students wishing for anonymity said their first group’s second tests will be on this coming Friday while the second group undergoing tests last Sunday will have their second tests during this next coming Sunday. The third group from the ‘SISAP divided three groups’ are yet to undergo their Covid-19 tests. Adding to fear, SISAP students raise that they might only end up getting infected at the Red Cross hospitals arranged for them to undergo covid-19 tests too since the setups there cannot be fully trusted, and they also have records of many positive cases in Philippines being tested there. “Such exposure to such hospitals arranged with the Red Cross might also be the place the first group of our students undergoing first tests have taken positive results, who knows. They are said to be asymptomatic so Covid-19 cannot be found,” said stressed SISAP students. “We say such because according to rumours here also, roommates are questioning how come our students have been tested positive with Covid-19 when they hardly leave their homes.” Despite everything, SISAP members urge Solomon Islands government to get them home as soon as possible. “Please bring us back home, we have been asking to return since the beginning of this year when covid-19 cases were still less in this country compared to China already then,” said SISAP students. “Whoever with negative and positive cases, we must all return home before the situation here worsens. The government has no other option but to just bring us back home now because we are citizens of Solomon Islands. “The government should prioritise its citizens in the first place. We want to return back to our parents and families. The government should try putting them in our shoes.” According to strict departure requirements, it is the Solomon Islands government requirement that all those planning to travel to Solomon Islands must undergo three tests, and all these tests must be negative before they could travel. Secretary to the Prime Minister Dr Jimmie Rodgers during the weekly talk-back show last Sunday said that the answer to the question of ‘should students come home now’ is “Without the shadow of doubt they must come home because the longer they remain there, the higher the exposer to contract the virus”. “But before they come home, we have to make sure they fulfil the pre-departure requirement process in Philippines and when they get here, they have to undergo mandatory quarantine under our laws and will only be released after three consecutive negative tests during the quarantine period.” Dr Rodgers said since Philippines is one of the high risk countries in terms of Covid-19, the students upon their arrival have to undergo 21 days quarantine. Solomon Airlines (SolAir) through their ‘Communications Unit’ this week confirming the approval of SIG and the Government of Philippines to operate three repatriation flights from Manila to Honiara also reminded that passengers regardless of their nationality or status ‘will and must’ undergo strict testing and quarantine protocols prior to, during and after arrival. The three repatriation flights from Manila to Honiara are scheduled to be on September 27 and September 29, with the third flight on October 27 said to be in the process of being confirmed. “All passengers regardless of their nationality or status will and must undergo strict testing and quarantine protocols prior to, during and after arrival. All incoming passengers must be individually approved and each traveller will have taken three COVID-19 tests in the 21 days before the flight. They will only be allowed to board the plane if all three tests are negative for COVID-19. “On arrival in Solomon Islands, all travellers will undergo a mandatory 21-day quarantine period and they will have a further three tests which must all be negative before they can be released,” said Solomon Airlines Communications Unit.",,,,,,,,,227,2.47

Opposition Leader Matthew Wale is sounding the alarm, calling on the national government to start taking measures to ensure that the citizens of Solomon Islands are protected from the Coronavirus. Currently reports say that the virus is spreading around the globe, and fast. Health experts are cautioning countries not to take these warnings lightly. In an interview with Australia Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) this week, infectious disease physician at the University of Melbourne, Dr Irani Thevarajan, said the symptoms are “Cough, shortness of breath, rapid breathing, sore throat, runny nose. A bit like the presentation of the common cold but obviously more severe.” Just to give an illustration of how serious the current threat is, the previous deadly SARS and MERS viruses that killed thousands of people worldwide are types of coronavirus. In a statement yesterday, Opposition Leader Mr Wale calls on government to take preemptive steps through the Ministry of Health & Medical Services to protect Solomon Islands from the outbreak of the Wuhan Corona Virus from Wuhan, China. Wale stressed that with confirmed cases in other parts of the world, the country should take this threat seriously and start planning preventive measures. He said many confirmed cases have been reported by international media including one in Brisbane, Queensland, which is being closely monitored and China has confirmed that the virus can be transmitted from human to human. Wale urges the government to take preventative measures early so that passengers returning to the country after Chinese New Year celebrations in China who might have been exposed to the virus are identified, quarantined and dealt with appropriately. He also stated that anyone with symptoms of the virus who was recently in Wuhan should not be allowed to travel to Solomon Islands until they are cleared of the symptoms. “Recent measures taken against the measles outbreak, although perhaps were a bit late, were appropriate given the scale of the outbreak” said Wale. He emphasised that government should act now and quickly and take similar measures against the new threat. The Opposition Leader also calls on fellow Solomon Islanders, especially those traveling in and out of the country to take precautionary measures as they travel and stay safe.",,,,,,,,,223,2.42

A concerned citizen Mr Johnson Mua said covid-19 originated from Wuhan in China and yet the Government is saying that testing kits will arrive in the country from China this week. While appreciating support from communist China, how sure and certain are we that the kits are not contaminated and will help Solomon Islanders conduct tests in the country accurately and safely? Mua asks. He said several countries around the world, for example Spain, have rejected kits from China for their low safety and accuracy levels. Just recently, Tonga cancelled an aircraft carrying medical supplies from China, he adds. With such reports, Mua questions why our government is not being vigilant towards having these China-supplies checked. Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare in his national address said testing kits from (PRC) will arrive next week and once these kits arrive, Solomon Islands will look at closing down the international entry airports. He said government understands international airports are possible entry points for COVID-19. On another news from the Government also said that China has expressed their commitment to provide support to the Government and people of Solomon Islands. A statement from the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in Honiara stated Guangdong Province is now in the process of donating several thousand facial masks and a few hundred protective garments to Solomon Islands. Meanwhile the Minister of Health and Medical Services Dickson Mua confirmed that the test kits from China will arrive in the country sometimes this week. Mr Mua said Beijing Geonomics Institution BGI is the reliable company for lab sequencing. “They do quality work in the field of genomics and sequencing producing some good lab resources”, Mr Mua said.

He says, the global pandemic has not made it easier to secure the COVID 19 Vaccines. “The global pandemic has not made it easier to secure COVID 19 vaccines this has led the Ministry of Health to accept the donation despite WHO’s process of reviewing the vaccine for its approval for its emergency use,” Mr Togamana says. The Health Minister adds, they are expecting WHO to approve the use of the Sinopharm vaccine soon.

WESTERN Province Premier Christian Mesepitu says his government is deeply concerned with the proposed security treaty with China. In a statement yesterday, Mesepitu said the Government at no time consulted provincial premiers on the proposed security arrangement. “Like many other Solomon Islanders, we were only made aware of the security arrangement on social media, and we are indeed very concerned,” he said. “For contentious issues, the National Government has the moral responsibility towards its agents, as part of consultations, to talk to us, and in some situations, convince us of their position,” Mesepitu added. He said this is particular concerning when considering the uncertain impacts this new security treaty might have on the proposed patrol boat base in Shortland Islands. The premier said the patrol boat base in Shortland is key to our long-term development plan to improve trade, security and enhance the movement and traditional people to people relations at the western border. “The last thing we would want to see is this patrol boat project compromised as a result of geopolitical differences between our partners which will greatly impact the long-term development plan of the facility,” he said. The Western provincial premier also raised concerns on the question of Solomon Islands’ need to diversify its security when we have an existing regional security arrangement. He said that instead of diversifying security, the government should seriously think about pursuing its decentralization policy. Mesepitu said a lot of social and economical issues in the country emerged as a result of development being heavily focused in Honiara. “The lack of proper health care services, education and jobs are some of the pull factors that are causing more people to seek opportunities in Honiara which also resulted in a lot of social problems,” he said. Premier Mesepitu said decentralization should be the government’s priority policy rather than trying to diversify our security to protect us against our own citizens. “We should be focused on creating more opportunities and jobs for our people in the provinces, enhance capacity building and human resources to help develop our provincial centres. “In line of that, more powers must be given to provinces to manage its own affairs. It is a hard ask but we need to make critical decisions and start somewhere,” he said. Meanwhile, the Western Premier also expressed concern over the recent leaked diplomatic correspondence requesting arms for an embassy by a development partner. “We do not need guns to protect us or drive our development ambitions. “We need to set our house in order and deal with our own internal problems not by way of guns but empowering our people and making good economic policies that will benefit our country,” he said.",https://www.facebook.com/theIslandSunNews/photos/a.1969037396760109/3019137075083464/?type=3,,,,,,,,210,1.28

Honiara City Council City Clerk, Rence Sore confirmed this when receiving 3,000 masks from China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd yesterday. Sore said the donation of masks came at the right time as HCC is discussing a contingency plan to combat covid-19. He said one of the plans is to control the movement of people at the market and distribute facemasks to the vendors. He said central market is operating at the heart of the city and as such population of market vendors is huge and that social distancing is not controlled. He said each day there are more than 1000 vendors selling their products so it is important for market vendors to use masks. At the same time, he encourages customers doing their shopping at the market to wear masks. He said the other plan is to fast track the completion of Kukum market so that some of them can be shifted to Kukum to sell their products. Sore said by doing that it would help the council assist market vendors practise social distancing. Currently 85 percent of the building is now completed. Market master Nelson Sakui said once they finalise all arrangement, they will start distributing the masks to the market vendors. He said market vendors who use the central market fulltime will have to use mask. Meanwhile, Sore acknowledges China Harbour for displaying its social responsibility by donating the facemasks. He said the council will use them to the maximum and good use for the benefit of the people. Sore added the donation will supplement other supplies donated by the People Republic of China. Acting General Manager Jinxing Yin said they are happy to support the city council with its contingency plan because they saw a lot of people going to the market every day.

The likelihood of the risk this trip poses to our health, wellbeing and livelihood is still high with regards to the covid-19 pandemic. This call comes after it was confirmed in the local media that the proposed direct flight to China will eventuate, despite the widespread opposition against it. Sharing her experience in quarantine as one of the returning nationals from New Zealand in one of the earlier repatriation flights, the SIDP President points out, Solomon Islands is nowhere close to being prepared to handle any outbreak of the covid-19 if it does enter. “Upon my return home from New Zealand, I went through its quarantine process and did the same again when I got back into the country. “I must admit that I am seriously worried, because a country with one of the best healthcare systems in the world, also resourced with highly trained health personnel, strong leadership, well organised team, modern technology and fully well-equipped are still experiencing a second wave of infections. This also seems to be the case for other developed countries. “Comparing theirs to our health system, along with the current level of our preparedness, I must add that we are still highly vulnerable, hence should be doing everything we can to avert any risk of importing the virus,” says Mrs Pollard. The SIDP President suggests that the government should prioritise the protection of our people above all else and not do anything to compromise that protection. “It is regrettable therefore that even with our obvious limitations, the government is still proceeding with plans for the PG2023. “This just does not make sense in light of the uncertain future covid-19 holds for the whole world. “Why should we take the risk just to run the Pacific Games programmes when according to World Health Organisation’s latest report on the future status of the virus, it will not go away until after two years’ time?” Pollard questioned. “I therefore strongly urge the Prime Minister to listen to the people and let us not do anything that we will live to regret later.” Solomon Islands Democratic Party is a member of the current Parliamentary Opposition Coalition group. --SIDP PRESS",,,,,,,,,206,2.24

Minister of Foreign Affairs and External Trade, Jeremiah Manele has confirmed in Parliament on Wednesday night that the planned direct flight to China and return to Honiara is chartered by the Chinese government. Manele said the PRC government is chartering Solomon Airlines to bring their diplomats and contractors to commence work on infrastructures for the Pacific Games in 2023. Among the confirmed passengers is China’s ambassador to Solomon Islands. All the passengers arriving on the flight will have to provide medical clearance of where they come from and when they arrive in Honiara will undergo mandatory quarantine. However, Independent Leader, John Dean Kuku queried if it is safe to organise flights from Brisbane and the proposed flight to and from China. “Why are we so concerned about the Western region borders and Bougainville?” Kuku asked. “Our people are moving in and out of Bougainville which at this moment is still covid-19 free compared to Australia and China which are not and therefore pose major risks to Solomon Islands,” he added. “We need to be consistent with the management and operational side of the Regulations.” Kuku said the Regulations should be advancing our cause to stop the pandemic coming into Solomon Islands and not impede our efforts to stop the risk. In addition, member of Opposition Group, Rick Hou said in this state of confusion, some government actions have seriously undermined its own policy and statements on the fight against COVID-19. “On one hand the government is telling our people of the danger from the virus and that it spreads through people, especially those coming from overseas; including China, where it all started. “The PM in moving the motion this morning (Tuesday), he reiterated further that the safety of our population takes priority over all else. “This is why the Government - through this Motion - is now asking Parliament to approve a new SOPE due to the continuing public health risk from the pandemic,” he said. “On the other hand, I understand the Government is now well advanced in arranging a special Solomon Airlines flight to pick 19 Chinese nationals, direct from China, into Solomon Islands to work on the PG 2023. “The delivery of an important project as the PG 2023 is a good call, but is it worth taking the risk? “The Government would like us to believe that China is now a low risk country – how can you be sure about?” Hou asked. The MP for Small Malaita and former Prime Minister said sending a Solomon Airlines aircraft and crew to China seems to him as too much of a gamble. “If that flight proceeded with it, it runs directly opposite to Government policy and would undermine government, steps needed to safeguard our people from the COVID-19 being introduced into our country. “Even if China was declared corona-virus-free (which it is not), the aircraft has to stop somewhere on its route to and from China. “How is the Government so sure that where the aircraft and its crew will stop is also corona free? “I cannot see how the Government, on one hand, is adamant that Solomon Islands remains very vulnerable to the virus – and therefore the urgency for Parliament to approve a new SOPE – while on the other hand, still prepared to take such a high risk action as this planned flight. “This is not the right message as to how the Government is fighting the virus. “So far the only luck we have had is that no infected person has entered the country as yet,” he said. Hou said on the importance of the PG2023, they know there are other more important, and bigger sporting events such as the Olympic Games, that had to be postponed, as a result of the pandemic. “What is so important and critical to this country about PG2023 that it cannot be postponed? “I think this is not only a bad idea, but in our current circumstances, it is a very risky one for the well-being of our people. “Additionally, proceeding with this flight will further undermine public confidence in government’s seriousness to deal with the virus and its efforts to ensure Solomon Islands remain corona-free,” he said.",,,,,,,,,200,2.17

Mr Kako, who is also chairman of Malaita Provincial Health Emergency Operation Committee (PHEOC), in an interview yesterday said he is aware of a plan to stage a peaceful protest against distributing the kits to Malaita. But, he says, the reality is Malaita needs those kits and this is one of those times where politics must be put aside for the sake of lives which are at stake. “Plans are in place and Malaita province will definitely receive the kits. We have process in place to clear the kits as consignment made for the safety of the kits. “Checks must thoroughly be done on the equipment to the extent that we are satisfied with it before distribution will happen. “So there shouldn’t be no fear on these received covid-19 supply kits from China. “People may question the quality of the PPEs as they came from China and covid-19 started in Wuhan, China, but let the kits subjected to checks. “If the kits are check and we satisfy, there won’t be no fear. And we really need the kits as preparation is mounting for this covid-19,” he said. On that note, Kako said Malaita province will receive the kits. He said MHMS prioritised distributing kits to Western and Choiseul provinces and Shortland Islands because they are the second emergency zone in the country. Dr Kako said this is because Papua New Guinea is currently with eight cases and there is risk that covid-19 may enter through the SI-PNG border. “So MHMS only disbursed kits to these areas including NRH as listed being in a red zone according to this state of emergency and covid-19 high risk criteria. “Other places or provinces are at the moment listed as medium or low risk and supplies will not yet prioritise for them. “But in a event where case is declared in the country, all provinces will be listed as red zone or high risk and supplies will distribute to all provinces,” he said.",https://www.facebook.com/theIslandSunNews/photos/a.1969037396760109/2482781632052347/?type=3,,,,,,,,197,1.2

This goes with the approval of the Solomon Islands Government according to Solomon Airlines. From Solomon Airlines Public Relations (PR) Office, the Airbus A320 services will transport approved foreign nationals and bring home stranded Solomon Islands citizens. “All passengers travelling on the flights have been approved by permission of the Prime Minister’s Office. Every passenger will be subject to strict COVID 19 requirements including providing proof of negative COVID 19 testing prior to boarding, in accordance with Government regulations,” said Solomon Airlines Public Relations. “The charter operation will first operate from Honiara to Guangzhou on Tuesday 1st September [today] returning again from Guangzhou to Honiara on Wednesday 2nd September [tomorrow]. The aircraft will stop briefly in Biak, Indonesia, in both directions for fuel, with no passengers or crew disembarking the aircraft. “On Thursday 3rd September, flight IE601 will return from Honiara to Brisbane, departing 12.00pm and arriving 2:15pm.

Solomon Airlines crew wear facemasks and gloves for duration of service and catering is minimal to reduce contact between passengers and crew.” The Government’s move to allow Solomon Airlines flight despite being heavily opposed by the general public in the country amidst Covid-19 Pandemic fear has raised eyebrows over such action.

Coronavirus, which started from China, is presenting a threat to the country with nearby countries like Australia reporting cases of the deadly virus. The disease is spreading worldwide and MHMS has taken the lead in putting in place measures. According to the MHMS Permanent Secretary, Mrs Pauline McNeil, their Ministry is preparing for the worst coronavirus posed. In a press statement, Mrs McNeil said their Ministry is taking proactive action to prevent possible importation of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) into the country. She stated measures are being strengthened at the airport and sea ports with increased surveillance of influenza like-illness in the Country. According to the statement, points of entry and information for travelers entering and leaving the country are among measures taken. “Considering how close these countries are to Solomon Islands, and the number of people travelling especially in the upcoming Lunar New Year season, the likelihood of importation of this infection in Solomon Islands cannot be ruled out. “We want to reassure the public we are preparing for that possibility,” Mrs McNeil said. She said the MHMS has formed a technical working group, including experts from the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF. “The essential medical supplies to handle cases of 2019- and Coronavirus are being mobilized and development partners are standing by with additional resources should these be needed. “As a ‘first line’ of defense MHMS is working with immigration and customs officials at ports and airports, training them on how to recognize cases of 2019-nCoV, incoming visitors will be provided with guidance on what to do once they think they have the infection,” Mrs McNeil said.",,,,,,,,,190,2.07

Most of the female students will pursue Bachelor, Diploma and certificates at Solomon Islands National University, USP Honiara campus, regional universities in Fiji, Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, Australia and Asia. They will be joined by the remaining 406 male recipients of the Pre-Service scholarship. Rough estimates of 978 scholarships were issued to both Pre-Service and In-Service with the latter receiving about 234 scholarships. The in-service recipients are mostly employees of the government and private sectors. Among the lists, there were some Year 12 students who will pursue diploma courses and self-sponsored students under the scholarship lists as well. Further to that about 100 scholarships were allocated to the 50 constituencies in the country. Some students have also benefited from the Cost sharing arrangement between the government and their families. Among the recipients, 37 scholarships were allocated to Master programmes and 3 doctorates (PHD). Unfortunately, students who have missed out in the scholarship lists will need to find other sponsorships to continue their studies this year. There were other students and employees who pursue their studies under the Australia, New Zealand and United Kingdom Scholarships. The Solomon Islands government has also received number of scholarships from other countries especially Peoples Republic of China (PRC) after the country severed ties with Republic of China (ROC) Taiwan in September last year. Minister of Education and Human Resources, John Moffat Fugui told Parliament during the sine die motion last month that the government has attracted number of scholarships from Peoples Republic of China (PRC), Russia and donors like Morocco, India and Indonesia. Fugui said following the normalisation of relationship with Peoples Republic of China (PRC), the ministry has received 103 internship scholarships. Fugui said soon the ministry will transit Solomon Islands students from Taiwan to mainland China. “We will negotiate few more scholarships from PRC come 2020,” he said. He said Russia has also indicated over 20 scholarships. Further to that, the minister said there are 10 scholarships from the government of Morocco and scholarships provisions from the government of India. He said there were scholarship offers from Government of Malaysia and their closest neighbour Indonesia. From the three billion, eight hundred and seventeen million, one hundred and fifty- five thousand, seven hundred and two dollars ($3,817,155,702) national budget passed.

The Prime Minister in his nation-wide address yesterday said despite this, repatriation flights for our students in the Philippines will still proceed. “Logistics, finance and the fact that students are scattered in different institutions around Philippines have made it difficult to get the required testings for all the students before the first flight dates that was previously announced,” he said. Moreover, Mr Sogavare said the Government through the Red Cross will also meet the costs for covid-19 testing for all passengers from Philippines, unlike the China flight which passengers have paid the testing costs themselves. “The testing will cost our Government around $ 1million. Nevertheless, the Government is committed to bring our students home safely,” he said. Sogavare also revealed that his office has also been informed that about 200 of our students cannot be repatriated because they have visa and passport issues and have been listed for deportation by the host country. Therefore, the Prime Minister said our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and External Trade are pleading our students’ case to facilitate their smooth return home. “To those critics that continue to misinform the public, this is no easy task and we must make sure that our testing protocols are met and our students are safe to return home. All these things are being done to protect our people and our country,” he said. The Prime Minister said despite the difficulties faced and the latest development regarding our students, the Government will do everything possible to bring our students in Philippines home safely. “Let us continue to pray for our students in Philippines and their families. I pray for our Father in Heaven to protect and give them strength and courage in the face of such great adversity.” --OPMC PRESS",,,,,,,,,189,2.05

This call came after it was revealed in the local media that the Minister for Provincial Government and Institutional Strengthening notified Premier Daniel Suidani of the government’s intention to suspend the Malaita Provincial Executive. “I strongly urge the Sogavare government to refrain from taking any decision that is likely to incite social disharmony at a time when the country needs to be united in the face of covid-19,” says Mr Wale. He says suspending the Malaita Provincial Executive risks undesirable outcomes that must be avoided, especially when such a decision, on the face of it, seems to be grounded on the selective enforcement of the law. He adds that while reasons have been provided, it is hard to ignore the fact that the decision may be directly linked to the stance taken by Malaita Province against the government’s decision to enter into diplomatic ties with China and that those reasons may well be a smoke screen to hide the government’s real intentions. Information at hand suggests that in 2017 under the current PM, the three Premiers from Malaita, Guadalcanal and Western Provinces took a trip to China as well in response to an invitation by the Friends of China Association, without any approval by the responsible ministry. “The travel by those three Premiers to China did not attract the same punishment that is now being threatened against Malaita Premier and Executive. There were also numerous other such overseas travel by provincial Premiers without approval from the Minister for Provincial Government. Why is Premier Suidani and Malaita being singled out now? “Further, in the recent past, provincial governments were not dissolved by the government even though Auditor General reports uncovered serious mismanagement, including illegal activity that should be grounds warranting suspension,” Wale points out. He further adds that, “Our country needs all our provinces to pull together now more than ever before, in light of the threat posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. This is not the time to be glorifying any particular foreign partner for assistance provided in our preparedness plans for the Covid-19, if this is what is going on. “I am concerned that the decision may derail any plans for the people of Malaita province in the government’s overall preparedness plans for the Covid-19. The threat posed by the Covid-19 pandemic affects all our peoples and so politics must not be allowed to stand in the way of our Covid-19 preparedness plans to protect our people’s health and well-being, including those from Malaita Province. “It is important that the government continue to dialogue with the Malaita Provincial government. Malaita must not be excluded from preparedness funding and activities solely because of its policy stance on the China switch decision,” the Opposition Leader stressed. Wale therefore calls on the government to embrace Malaita in a genuine effort to resolve any policy issues, including the possibility of agreeing to disagree on some policy issues. “No policy disagreement should be weighty enough to warrant punitive action against Malaita province,” he said. --OPPOSITION PRESS",https://www.facebook.com/theIslandSunNews/photos/a.1969037396760109/2487658138231363/?type=3,,,,,,,,184,1.12

It is important that the Prime Minister explain to the nation why he has authorized his Finance Minister to pursue this.” Mr. Wale stated, Solomon Islands GDP is currently only around SBD10 Billion. USD100 Billion borrowing is 80 times more than the current Solomon Islands GDP and it is obviously beyond the capacity of the economy to service debt at such levels.

Matthew Wale blasts the Prime Minister and the government for the predicament that has befallen our Philippines students. “I truly feel for the parents and relatives of our students. It is unimaginable what they have been put through and I can only hope that the ordeal will go away soon,” the Opposition Leader shared. The Opposition Leader says he is however stunned by the response by the PM and the government over this issue. “The PM’s attempt to justify the delay in giggles is simply lame and characteristic of his shrewd politics in recklessly belittling the gravity of serious issues. “From the admissions by the Permanent Secretary for Education, it is clear that the government mishandled the whole situation from the start,” says Hon. Wale. He says not only are 6 of our students now infected, but many of them have also had problems with their visas and allowances. “It is therefore naive, inexcusable and un-statesman of the PM to make excuse that the delay in bringing our students home was because of the inability to secure tests for the students in Philippines. “How can this be so, when the government had 7 months at its disposal to repatriate the students and avert all other issues since they first made their request, and in that period, the PM had all the powers under the Emergency Regulations to do whatever is necessary to safeguard their health?” Wale questioned. The Opposition Leader adds that “The PM need to understand that he is duty bound to inform people about what actually happened. 7 months is adequate time for any government to make decisions and arrangements. Instead, we get a lame excuse”. Wale says it is even quite telling that a Cabinet Paper was put forward after the students first made their request for repatriation no action was taken. “What happened to this paper? If the health and welfare of our citizens was important as repeatedly stated by the PM, why didn’t Cabinet make a decision on the request early? “If the decision made was for our students to remain in the Philippines, why the delay in providing their allowances in good time which had previously caused them a lot of problems?” the Opposition Leader further questioned. Hon. Wale points out that the PM’s lame attempt in explaining the situation therefore is just an attempt to brush under the carpet the blunder and the negligence of those responsible. “It is no small matter that we now have the health and wellbeing of all our student in the Philippines at stake and it is regrettable that the PM finds it amusing to giggle over these issues. “It is also shameful how the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and External Trade handled the expiry status of our students’ visas, while they had 7 months they only managed to secure some exemptions. “What has this ministry been doing? Isn’t this one of their responsibilities? Someone must explain what is going on for clearly the affected students are faced with an unwanted situation of deportation. “Is it the case that the welfare of our Philippines students was not a priority for our Foreign Affairs and PMO because they were busy making arrangements for the flight to China? “Or is it because the China flight was more important to the government because it will bring in Chinese foreign diplomats and Chinese businessman connected to government politicians? Why did the China flight take precedent over our student’s health and safety? Where is the balance in these decisions? Someone must explain,” adds Hon. Wale. He says the situation could have easily been averted if the government had listened to the earlier pleas of the students and their parents. “Instead it waited. For what?” He adds that seven months is clearly an inordinate delay and the PM must accept the blame. “What happens from hereon is crucial and so the PM must not try and dodge the gravity of the situation this country is faced with now. “I therefore call on the PM to come out clean and explain the real cause of the problem. This is a serious situation. Our students have contracted the virus. Parents and the public are entitled to know what went wrong,” Wale further added.",,,,,,,,,177,1.92

Malaita Province Ministers of the Executive, Members of the Malaita Provincial Assembly, the Provincial Secretary for Malaita Province, senior MPG officials, fellow Malaitans, ladies, and gentlemen. Today we are gathered together to say thank you and share our sincere heartfelt gratitude to our dear friend the Republic of China – Taiwan’s Government and its generous people. As we know the world is still at war with an invisible enemy that has claimed so many lives almost right across the entire globe. An enemy that has not only claimed lives but also brought colossal hardships to the many big and the small economies of the world. This unprecedented pandemic has shaken the world to its core and has the world searching for answers and a cure for the last 6 months. The Coronavirus or the COVID 19 pandemic has awakened the world to re-examine many of the global arrangements that are put in place to facilitate the global economy for the progress and prosperity of mankind. Fellow Malaitans today we are in a unique and privileged situation to have been assisted by a country that has stood against the might of the Wuhan virus. A country that is so close in its proximity to the epicenter of the decease but has built resilience to withstand and conquer the decease and its devastating effects. Fellow Malaitans, I need not shout it out for you or the world to know nor do I have to whisper the name of this great country to you, since I know its name has always been there buried deep within our hearts. Taiwan as we know has shown the world again, the resilience and the cooperative spirit of mankind in times of great human tragedy. Taiwan has shown that in a free and fair society mankind can stand against any adversary be it visible or invisible. In this light Malaita province, its people and the MARA Government dare not to be intimidated by any frameworks put up by anyone to disadvantage the progressive spirit of its people. Taiwan has shown to the world a great example of people that small it may in their geography and population. Their hearts, abilities, and care have reached, touched, and cure many lives across the world that have suffered as a result of the Wuhan virus. We, therefore, stand here today to echo from the bottom of our hearts to the government and loving people of Taiwan our most sincere and heartfelt gratitude for the support you have given us. Your support to my people continues to rekindle the long-standing friendship between the people of Malaita Province and the people of Taiwan. Our peoples have come to share the same values and principles and it is my strongest belief that no amount of institutional deprivation will overcome these shared human commonalities. Fellow Malaitans, some may like to say that Malaita is but a province of the Solomon Islands. The truth in such thinking no doubt has its place in the governance of the Solomon Islands. However, there is further truth that the Melanesian and Polynesian races that have settled the land and the seas now today called Malaita have been here since time immemorial. The shaping and reshaping of their survival abilities and human endurances have not just started with the creation of the nation-state the Solomon Islands. It must, therefore, be understood that the basic instincts to keep the races alive and survive has always there in our DNAs. What we are doing today to reach out for the protection of our survival is nothing new. It looks new only because of the newly introduced frameworks and institutional setups. However, the limitations under these frameworks must not be used to limit our ability as a people to find appropriate support in times like this. Where we have in front of us a deadly decease capable of wiping us from the surface of the earth. Fellow Malaitans, ladies, and gentlemen let us once more applaud the people and the government of Taiwan for their generous support. Also, we must thank our God almighty for its saving grace and its continuous love for us. Let us be with him in his wisdom as we celebrate this wonderful gift from our dear friends from the other side of the vast Pacific Ocean. May God bless the hand that gives and those that have received what has been given. ......Malaita Provincial Government - Press Release",https://www.facebook.com/sundayisles/photos/a.432226406855960/3015045495240692/?type=3,,,Photos from Sunday Isles's post,,,,,173,7.86

PRIME MINISTER MANASSEH SOGAVARE ON THE CURRENT TAIWAN_CHINA ISSUE Fellow Solomon Islanders, we have endured many challenges since we attained Independence in 1978 in trying to forge our path towards achieving economic prosperity, social stability and lasting peace for the sake of future generations and the common good of our people. With the foresight of past leaders combined with the commitment of local stakeholders and support of our development partners, steady progress has been made in some sectors of the economy, institutional governance and delivery of public services, yet the majority of our national development objectives and sustainable development goals are yet to fully materialize. Our country is prone to natural disasters, economic shocks, political and social instability which represent some of the fundamental challenges we face on our development journey to harmonize our cultural diversities so we can work together to shed the burden of dependency and become economically self-sufficient. It is with deep gratitude that I express on behalf of my family and all members of the DCGA, my heartfelt thanks and appreciation for the support rendered by Taiwan over the past 36 years is an enduring friend and development partner who has stood with us during some of our darkest hours, the gratitude for which the change of diplomatic recognition will never take away. Fellow Solomon Islanders, diplomatic friendships are based on shared values, mutual respect and national interests which in the case of Taiwan we have reciprocated the support they have rendered over the past 36 years, by availing our marine resources and advocating to the United Nations (UN) for their right to self-determination as an independent sovereign nation despite the stand taken by the other 176 UN Member countries. Unfortunately, our plea over the past 36 years has been in vain and will continue to remain as such based on international law, the respect for territorial integrity, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality, mutual benefit and peaceful coexistence that collectively represent the fundamental principles of the Charter of the United Nations. Further, the democratic system within Taiwan consists of two major political parties, the currently ruling DPP that maintains a pro-independence stance for Taiwan, and the KMT that maintains a reunification policy. The National elections are in January 2019 and having been through this cycle in the past, the Solomon Islands is better served making a decision that reflects our long term development interests rather than being uncertain over what might happen should one day Taiwan democratically decide to reunite with Mainland China. Formal recognition of the sovereignty of the Peoples Republic of China under the UN Resolution 2758 is supported by all UN countries except 16 underdeveloped nations which raises questions over whose interests does this minority support of small nations serve to represent against the vast majority of the global democracy? Solomon Islands cannot answer for other nations but to determine the most appropriate way forward for the good of our country and people is the reason why Cabinet collectively decided on the appointment of a Bi-Partisan Taskforce to investigate and confirm the facts surrounding the ‘One China Principle’ while MFAET was also tasked to provide a report on the review of our diplomatic ties with Taiwan. The outcome of both reports confirmed that while we cannot deny the long standing friendship we have maintained with Taiwan, the future stability and well-being of Solomon Islands depends on our own ability to engage at the international level with development partners capable of advancing our national interests while we develop opportunities, strengthen our institutions, effectively manage resources and remain united in our quest for peace, prosperity and progress in the future best interests of our country. Recent interventions made by the USA who recently re-emerged to confirm their support for our development initiatives by committing to the establishment of an Embassy and offering funding for the proposed National Transport Core Initiative, were made with the assurance that any sovereign decision on diplomatic recognition would be respected and not conditional on the outcome. The written invitation by the Vice President Mike Nations General Assembly to discuss the assistance package being prepared by the US government was graciously accepted although no commitment was made in response to the Vice President’s request to delay a decision on the One China question only that it would be taken into consideration. Therefore, it was very disappointing to note that recent media reports and statements made by Vice President Pence misrepresent the understanding we had established both through dialogue and written communications. I will look forward to meeting Vice President Pence in the future to (truncated)",,,,,,,,,172,-2.05

Kenilorea said what has unfolded is a clear indication that citizens of this country had been fed with half-truths all along. In a statement, the Opposition MP said the leaked documents have shown that it is a request by China to arm its embassy. “While it is not clear if the proposal in the letters to allow the Chinese embassy to bring in arms were approved by Cabinet, it is a matter of serious concern,” he said. Kenilorea said the request is concerning as it undermines our obligation as host country under international law to protect High Commissions and Embassies on our soil. “If we turned the tables and asked Beijing to arm our diplomats in the Solomon Islands Mission in Beijing, they will never allow it. So why should we allow this on our shores?” Kenilorea asked. The leaked documents showed a diplomatic note from the Embassy of China to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, dated 3 December 2021. In it, China requested permission from the Solomon Islands Government to allow its 10-man plainclothes security team, with necessary light weapons and equipment, to be stationed at its embassy in Honiara. The team, the diplomatic note requested, will provide internal security and necessary escort missions outside of the Embassy. China also informed the government that all 10 personnel will hold diplomatic passports with official status as Attache of the Embassy mission. The diplomatic note also provided a list of the light weapons and equipment the security team intends to bring with them for use while they are here for the initial six to 12 months period. On receiving the note, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade Colin Beck, communicated the request to his colleague Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Police and National Security Karen Qalokale. Beck’s letter was copied to the Office of the Prime Minister. Island Sun was unable to confirm yesterday whether the 10-man security team was already here. But Kenilorea said the leaked diplomatic notes have raised more questions whether the weapons listed on the leaked documents are part of the riot gears and arms shipment earlier last month. He said the continuous secret dealings must be clarified for the sake of transparency and public trust. “In diplomatic protocol, the request to arm workers of a foreign embassy is not the norm,” he said. Kenilorea said we are living in abnormal times where the general public and public servants are beginning to ask serious questions. “Were the replicas secretly imported to the country part of the plot to conceal real weapons?” he questioned. He said the country’s sovereignty is at stake and people’s fundamental rights, which include the right to protection by our government is also a serious matter. “You have an unusual situation where a donor supplies replica arms for our law enforcement and yet imports real weapons for themselves, with the blessing of the government,” he said. Kenilorea said an unfortunate precedent has been set and undermines our sovereignty and it is even concerning when we allow our diplomatic partners to arm their embassies. He said the Foreign Relations Committee would be seriously considering looking into this matter. . “The arrival of the 10 Chinese personnel’s was also kept secret, the guns shipment were also kept secret, the China security MOU was also kept secret. “What else is the government hiding from the citizens of this country?” Kenilorea questioned. Comments are being sought from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade on the issue.

Liloqula said that if it has to, the government must find a loan whose dealings are transparent and from credible sources and not from shady and suspicious characters that more or less bear the hallmark of a scam. She further added that clouds hang over the USD$100 billion loan proposal, a cynical undertaking that deserves no consideration from day one. Liloqula further stated that the government also needs to break its silence over the issue and inform the people as to the purpose of the loan.

Wale made this statement following new information from Canberra that Australia will pump $45.7 million to help fund Australia's deployment of police and troops in Solomon Islands until the Pacific Games in 2023. The Opposition Office said it obtained a recording from the Senate estimates hearing yesterday morning in Canberra, which the Chief Operating Officer of the Australian Federal Police told the hearing that the money would actually cover a range of other activities. The Opposition Leader has raised concerns that apart from the Pacific Games, Australia will also be ‘establishing a multipurpose use of force training centre for public order management training, establishing a mobile protection unit, accelerating stage two rearmament, increasing public order management, and some operational vehicles as well.’ Wale questioned the motive behind plans to ‘accelerate stage two of RSIPFs rearmament programme’. “Why the rush?” he questioned. “Australia is the genie granting Sogavare all his wishes and apparently they are terrified and are obliged to do so knowing that if they don’t, China will do so,” he said. Wale said it is alarming, as it seems that Australia’s immediate strategy now is trying to militarise the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force (RSIPF). He said Australia should rather increase its investment in education as the key to building long-term security in Solomon Islands. “Militarising the RSIPF to outcompete China to meet Sogavare’s personal security needs will result in the suppression of political rights. “A corrupt government being protected by Australia against accountability to the people,” he said. --OPPOSITION PRESS",,,,,,,,,170,1.83

Accusations about the Prime Minister blocking US support for Malaita are misleading and inaccurate due to the fact that the funding support for Solomon Islands Infrastructure projects recently announced by the United States Ambassador to PNG, welcomed by the Prime Minister, was not conditional on the sovereign decision over diplomatic ties with Taiwan or China, it says. The Solomon Islands Government is supportive of all development efforts by all Development Partners and is committed to see developments in all provinces of Solomon Islands. Meanwhile the statement adds, in terms of being the first country in the world to take such an approach to the policy question over cross strait relations, the process was fully transparent and the final decision made in compliance with our democratic principles of governance and the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relation 1961. OPMC emphasized, it was in the DCGA's 100 Days policy to review the country's diplomatic relations and in particular the 'China question' the outcome of which was decided by Caucus and Cabinet under the mandate of democratically elected Leaders.

The anti-corruption watchdog explains that this government decision makes hollow a lot of the statements that Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare has been making about prioritising the safety of Solomon Islands from covid-19 and ensuring that the country’s covid-free status is maintained. In TSI’s media statement yesterday, it says: “Transparency Solomon Islands (TSI) is not only appalled but very concerned with announcement by the Secretary to Prime Minister Dr Jimmy Rogers with the plan to bring Chinese officials to Solomon Islands via a direct flight from China to Honiara. “The intended flight was announced by Secretary to Prime Minister’s Office Mr Rodgers who earlier revealed that the flight from China to Honiara will bring in officials to work on the preparation for the 2023 South Pacific Games (SPG). It is not justifiable to risk the free COVID 19 status of Solomon Islands for a game that is going to last for a couple of weeks. “Furthermore, an article published this week quoted in a talk back show on Sunday Permanent Secretary (PS) to Ministry of Foreign Affairs Mr Collin Beck confirmed the direct flight from Honiara to China is set for 29th August. Have we gone crazy over our newfound friend or is Solomon Islands now a satellite city of the Communist Party of China? “It is obvious that the move to repatriate stranded Solomon Islanders studying in China is a cover up to bring in some Chinese on a direct flight from China and a move to calm down strong objections by the public on the planned China-Honiara flight. “If government is concerned about citizens then talk with Chinese government, our other diplomatic friends and find others options to bring home our stranded citizens in China or bring them when it is safe for them to travel to this covid-19-free country, whilst asking the Chinese Government to look after them a little bit longer. It is safer there for them to remain in China than bringing in them now, because it will put the nation at high risk of any possible outbreak if we allow the direct flight from the birth country of the virus into Solomon Islands. TSI knows that those who have relatives there would like them home, but they should also be made aware of the risks to them their immediate and extended families and people at large. More planning and innovative thinking is needed. The SP Games is not a good enough excuse. “Prime Minister must exercise with responsibility the entrusted power people gave him under this State of Public Emergency (SoPE). A direct flight to bring in people from China to Honiara would be seen as a negligence of his responsibility under this SoPE or a gross abuse of emergency powers entrusted on him. “If Peterson Boso was arrested for spreading rumors about the covid-19 and Dr Claude Posala was terminated from his job for posting covid-19 related issues then why this direct flight from China is allowed. This is the action that poses more risks on the lives of people than the Facebook posts. “PM Sogavare in his key remarks when addressing the nation during his weekly covid-19 address says any confirm positive case of corona virus entering the country could be catastrophic for the nation. “He went on to describe the current rate of infection and death related to covid-19 around the globe as frightening. Also, Dr Rodgers … says at the weekly talk back show on Sunday that the increasing number of infections and deaths related to the current health pandemic is very worrying. “These well-meaning assurances is now completely contradicted by Dr Rodgers’ statement on this direct flight and by Prime Minister if he allows such a flight to happen. It is confusing as to who is the person in authority the Prime Minister, or Dr Rogers, for Dr Rogers seem to be doing things contrary to what the Prime Minister assures the country. This direct flight to bring in people from China to Honiara is one such incidence. The Prime Minister says he will protect the COVID 19 free status of Solomon Islands and here is his SPM announcing direct flight to China. “Their decision for a direct flight from China to Honiara is a slap on the face of those hardworking authorities who continue to monitor and provide securities at the international borders. Their decision to allow a direct flight from China to Honiara only shows that our leaders are serving their foreign masters without exercising the sovereign rights of this country to protects its citizens. “Furthermore, the much talk-about preparation for SPG 2023 is not as important as the safety and health of citizens from being infected with the virus. “There are international sporting events being cancelled due to covid-19 because health of citizens of those hosting countries is the priority of their leaders, who made decisions to protect their (truncated)",,,,,,,,,165,1.79

This is part of the embassy’s due diligence to make sure all is safe for us,” shares an optimistic Renbel premier, Willie Tuhagega. With this endeavour, Mr Tuhagega is reportedly pursuing development aspirations of his province, primarily on tourism and fisheries. Other sectors, Tuhagega says will also be included as the relationship grows. Speaking to the paper earlier this week, Mr Tuhagega says it is high time Renbel province sees real development; and unlike his predecessors, he is seriously pursuing this agenda with the support of his executive. Renbel province is the smallest in the country, and despite being in receipt of millions of dollars over the past years it remains the least developed province in Solomon Islands. This is something which Tuhagega is determined to remedy. Late last month Mr Tuhagega met with an agent of the consultant who will work towards linking up Renbel with the authorities in Zhejiang province. Tuhagega says despite what many anti-Chinese sentiments critics publish, the Peoples’ Republic of China is here and is interested to help in development, which is the main reason the national government chose to establish diplomatic ties with it last year. “And, as far as Rennell and Bellona province interest is concerned, if China offers to help develop our province, then we are all for it, and we likewise welcome and embrace PRC with gratitude. “The PRC embassy here will first have to endorse it after it has done its check on the consultant in China, mainly to see if it is a genuine entity, and also protect Renbel province in this endeavour, something we are grateful to the PRC embassy for. “Early this month, we met with the PRC ambassador to discuss our proposed plan to establish sister relations with Zhejiang province for long term friendship and development assistance.” Premier Tuhagega praises the PRC embassy for its role in ensuring that if any partnership should be struck with any potential sister province in China it would be for mutual benefit of both parties. “As I told His Excellency the PRC Ambassador when we met earlier this month, we are happy and are looking forward to this endeavour, and he also expressed his delight in our courtesy call, and our embracing of PRC and their goodwill offer to help the country. “His Excellency told me that our meeting was the beginning of many good things to come, and this sounds good to any leader of Rennell and Bellona who aspires to develop his province. “The letter of invitation to the Zhejiang province to establish sister relations and our recognition of the consultant in China to help facilitate the link has been submitted, and we are just waiting, when the embassy is ready they will call us.” This promising initiative is seen as a positive development on its own, which offers a lot of employment, infrastructure, education etc for the people of Rennell and Bellona should it come to be fulfilled. Renbel province, although regarded as the smallest in Solomon Islands, has a huge sea area and has the country’s largest coral reef, the Indispensable Reef. The two islands are often referred to as the largest raised atolls in the world, and Rennell island hosts the country’s only World Heritage site, the Lake Tegano. However, the rich marine resources and the tourism potentials of Renbel remain to be untapped. On the other hand, Zhejiang province of China, according to Wikipedia, is an eastern, coastal province of the People's Republic of China. Its capital and largest city is Hangzhou. Zhejiang is bordered by Jiangsu and Shanghai to the north, Anhui to the northwest, Jiangxi to the west, and Fujian to the south. To the east is the East China Sea, beyond which lies the Ryukyu Islands. The population of Zhejiang stands at 57 million, the 10th highest among China. Other notable cities include Ningbo and Wenzhou. It has been called 'the backbone of China' due to being a major driving force in the Chinese economy. After China's economic reform, Zhejiang has grown to be considered one of China's wealthiest provinces, ranking fourth in GDP nationally and fifth by GDP per capita, with a nominal GDP of CN￥5.62 trilion (US$849 billion) as of 2018. Zhejiang's economy is based on electromechanical industries, textiles, chemical industries, food, and construction materials.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China organised a video conference on Tuesday 5pm (2pm Beijing) to allow its 10 diplomatic allies in the Pacific to watch the live presentation of: 1. Dr Wu Zunyou, Chief Epidemiologist of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention and 2. Dr Wang Guiqiang, Chief Physician, Department of infectious diseases, Peking University First Hospital. Solomon Islands watched at the video conference at China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) compound at Lunga. The other allies that watched the video in their offices were Papua New Guinea, Fiji, Samoa, Vanuatu, Tonga, Federate States of Micronesia, Nauru, Niue and Kiribati. After the presentation, PNG was given the opportunity to make a statement on the virus before the rest of the Pacific Islands Countries have asked questions on the presenters. Dr Wu said about 69 percent (5938) have related exposure to the virus in Wuhan, 15 percent (1316) contact with confirmed cases and 16 percent (1402) no known exposure history. These statistics are based on the 8656 confirmed cases. He said China has applied community level responses strategy to counter the virus. They divided the communities into three categories namely community with no confirmed cases, communities with confirmed cases and communities with spreading of the epidemic. Dr Wu said 1.4 billion people nationwide underwent 10 days of at home isolation. He said in Hubei province where Wuhan is, 59.2 million people were subjected to cordon sanitaire or prevented from leaving the area. Dr Wu said 50,000 hospital beds were opened for COVID-19 patients (including 3 new hospitals plus 16 temporary module hospitals). He said 40,000 health workers were deployed to Hubei. “Majority of cases arise from close contacts of symptomatic cases; 1.5 percent of 38000 close contacts developed COVID-19 in 3 areas. “Transmission is driven by family clusters (i.e. 75-85 percent of clusters),” he said. Dr Wu said two percent households attack rate were 10 percent early in the outbreak and fell to three percent in with faster isolation. He said transmission in close settings is happening but is not a major driver in China (e.g. health facilities, nursing homes and prisons). “Transmission in schools has been observed- this may simply be because of the closure of schools during most of the outbreaks,” he said. Solomon Islands was represented by Ministry of Health and Medical Services officials, Ministry of Foreign Affairs and External Trade, Secretary to Prime Minister Dr Jimmy Rodgers and media. Undersecretary for Public Health Dr Nemia Bainivalu said the video conference was very informative. “I will certainly share this response with my team on some of the things to apply in Solomon Islands case for preparation,” he said. Like other Pacific Islands countries, Solomon Islands has also come up with preventative measures to deal with the coronavirus.

Dates were already in plan, the Oversight Committee said, but the Philippines flight was pushed back because of ‘technical’ reasons; they had to make sure they implement decisions in a way that is safe for the country and people coming in. Secretary to the Prime Minister Dr Jimmie Rodgers on behalf of the Oversight Committee in a Press Conference this week, when asked about Transparency Solomon Islands (TSI) criticism that the “Government chose to prioritise the China trip over the Philippines trip”, said it only seems to him that TSI is more about inciting people’s perceptions. “Did we? To start with TSI, I do not know whether they do justice to their name anymore. Because it seems to me that TSI is more about inciting people’s perceptions, not based on facts,” said Rodgers. “If we went, the whole thing about going to China was the virus will come in, and of course they said we said 53 nationals and then I think 21 came and then of course we were accused of lying. No, the 53 nationals were all on the list. Most of them decided they want to stay on. They changed their own mind, not the government. So, the plane coming back was not full. If all of them came it would be full. “Okay so the government did not prioritise the China flight ahead of the Philippines flight? In fact we pushed the flight back just a little bit just to make sure why, once a political decision is made, we have a political government, the reason it was pushed back is because on the technical side we got to make sure that we implement that decision in a way that is safe for the country and people coming in. “Our job is to make sure that all the protocols are observed, so four people were not allowed to board because they did not follow those protocols. And then all those that came in, probably some of them will go out today [yesterday].

He made this clarification over claim by academics saying the US$25 million assistance to Malaita is part of USA’s geostrategic struggle with China in the Pacific. Dr Terence Wood from the Australian National University's Development Policy Centre said the US funding is 50 times what Malaita received in total from aid donors last year. ""I'd almost certainly think that the United States is focusing on Malaita right now because it sees Malaita as a potential source of support, in its own geostrategic struggle with China in the region,"" he said. The five-year funding for Malaita targets agriculture and the environment and aimed to boost the economy of the province. PRC Ambassador Li Ming told Island Sun that China is pleased to see other countries in and out of region provide assistance to Pacific Island Countries including Solomon Islands to benefit their people. Ming said China’s assistance to Solomon Islands and other Pacific countries is different to Western countries because it is based on equality, mutual respect and mutual benefit. He said there is no geo politic involved in any project that benefit Solomon Islands and Pacific Island Countries. “We do things through in-depth consultation and discussion. “We fully respect the ideas and wishes of other developing countries and never imposed ideas,” he said. According to Pacific Beat in Radio Australia, the funding comes as Malaita's relations with the national government is at its lowest, because of its opposition to the government's decision last year to switch diplomatic ties from Taiwan to China. Malaita continues to back Taiwan - which China sees as a breakaway province - and in recent months has called for an independence referendum. But Chad Morris the Public Affairs Officer for the United States Embassy in Papua New Guinea, has rejected this. He said support for Malaita was upon request by the government and has been in the works for the past two years. ""Like with the many programs with the US government there is a fairly lengthy process to go through...there is no intention to make this a political move,"" he said. On the ground, Malaita Premier Suidani has welcomed the funding, describing it as a gift from a true friend. ""Nothing in such magnitude have ever been seen and felt by my people of Malaita Province since Solomon Islands gained independent in 1978. But in Honiara, the US announcement caught many by surprise including government officials. A government statement said the funding would be subject to government processes with Cabinet to have the final approval and cautioned against misinformation.",https://www.facebook.com/theIslandSunNews/photos/a.1969037396760109/2632806517049857/?type=3,,,,,,,,151,-1.09

PS Daonga said two separate Contingency Warrants of $25 million each were raised to pay the MPs. He said for the other component where Republic of China (ROC) Taiwan funded under the 2019 national budget was $70 million. Each MP was eligible to receive $1.4 million each from this funding. However, PS Doanga said ROC managed to pay $300,000 each before it left. This brought the total allocation to $15 million funded by ROC. As such, the Peoples Republic of China came onboard and met the remaining $55 million to cover the gap. In terms of subvention and cash grants, PS Daonga said some constituencies applied for materials and cash. He said for cash grant, the ministry only allows $1 million as agreed by Caucus. Daonga said this year $2 million was allocated for materials. “Constituencies need to make submissions or proposals in order to access the funds. “Some constituencies ask for cash grants to pay materials,” he said.

The hotel could not withstand the enormous impact caused by the virus that started in Wuhan, China last December after cancellation of bookings by tourists due to lockdown in Australia, Papua New Guinea and Fiji. General Manager, Sanjay Bhargava said the situation was really bad. Bhargava said there is no business as everything closes including accommodation and conferences. He said even some of the long stayers have left to their country due to the virus threats. As such result, Bhargava said the hotel has lost around $3 million since cancellation of bookings in mid-February. “We have laid off 80-100 staff by giving them their last fortnight on March 15. “There is no pay for repatriation and others,” he said. As part of short term measures, Bhargava said there are only 30 staffs doing three shifts working to maintain the services in the restaurant and keep the property. He said the management also control the power usage in the Hotel to cut down on costs. The hotel was opened to the public on August 27, 2009 and it has retained its original structure in the main building. It was during the time the ethnic conflicts had subsided in 2005, Papua New Guinea based business magnate and the current Solomon Islands Trade Commissioner to Papua New Guinea, Sir Kostas Constantinou, dared to venture in to the country with a dream and a business proposal. He had the foresight and the vision that the country would rebuild its infrastructure and would be making strides towards modernity. Tourism being one of the cornerstones in most economies, Solomon Islands would also look towards the sector and this would necessitate a hotel which would be able to meet the demands of the modern traveller. He scouted around for a likely location and would settle for nothing but the one on which the hotel currently stands. The Superannuation fund of Papua New Guinea was also looking for a possible investment in the country and thus became a willing partner. Subsequently the SI Provident Fund came on board the company to one of its most prestigious investments. Commercial operations started in 2009, and six years down the line the Heritage Park Hotel has managed to carve a name for itself in the hospitality sector of the Pacific. However, currently the hotel is facing one of the challenges in business after laying off most of its workers.",,,,,,,,,148,1.61

Matthew Wale was disappointed with revelations that the huge government Mamara Tasivarongo Housing Development Project for public servants in the Northwest Guadalcanal plains, has no room for the recruitment of locals and questions why this is so. ""It is disappointing to note that when the country is in dire need of any employment opportunities for locals, such a huge project which has the potential of yielding over thousands of jobs, offers no answer and it is even more surprising that this is taking place with government approval or ignorance. ""For any government, it should be at the forefront of its economic policy that every big investment opportunities must be accompanied by strict conditions to reserve all job opportunities for locals, save where the level of expertise is not available locally. It should not matter whether the project is short term or not,"" Wale said. The Opposition Leader said it only needs to look at some of the structures around that locals have built to see the high standard of workmanship that is available locally. ""I therefore question why this is so? This seems to be a norm when it comes to huge projects that involve Chinese investors. ""Information at hand also suggest the same is also happening with the SPG 2023 construction work at the old Telekom area at Ranadi and complaints by locals involved with logging companies in the logging industry,"" The Opposition Leader said. He furthers that if this is a trend silently endorsed by the government, it is a matter of public concern and only repeats the concept of boomerang aid which is something that has been tagged with other donors other than China for long. Wale said unfortunately, this is what happens when the government sides with investors against the interests of its people, where indigenous Solomon Islanders are squeezed out of opportunities, and government does nothing about it. Un-employment rate in Solomon Islands is at its highest and it is expected to grow over the coming years if nothing is done. Thus it is urgent that the government do something as it is becoming a time bomb which can lead to ongoing unwanted social issues and disunity.

A site has been identified around the Mamara New City area, west of Honiara following discussions with the Guadalcanal Provincial Government, they said. The proposed hospital will also complement the work of the National Referral Hospital (NRH) in terms of easing the congestion, especially at the Emergency Department, which has to cope with a growing number of sick patients on a daily basis, the insiders said. “Our situation is such that demands have far outstripped services due to population growth. The fact that clinics in the city only operates from 8am to 5pm daily simply compounds the problem,” the insiders said. They said the plan for a General Hospital had been costed out, but they stopped short of saying whether the national government has approached donors about funding this important facility. “We’ve evaluated the cost and the sort of facility we are looking at will cost SBD100 million. It is a General Hospital, which will also have staff housing. It is a package we are looking at,” the insiders said. Asked why Mamara, one insider said the location aligns well with government policy to deliver important services such as health to the rural people. They said also that no suitable land could be found elsewhere in and around Honiara, which is also running out of public land big enough to host important facility such as hospitals. The Minister of Health and Medical Services, Culwick Togamae, told Solomon Star this week, he was aware of the plan to build a General Hospital. Dr. Togamae said he was also aware of the discussions between the Ministry of Health and Medical Services and Guadalcanal Province. He was however dismissive of suggestions that the government could not proceed with construction because there was no money. “No, money is not a problem,” he said. The People’s Republic of China (PRC) initially identified a new National Referral Hospital as one of three priority projects. However, this has now changed based on the government’s priorities. Upgrade of facilities, including dormitories at the Solomon Islands National University [SINU] has taken priority after the 2023 Pacific Games.

And, this is not going down well with concerned parents. Parents are calling on bus operators to revisit their humanity and not allow profit driven desires to blind them. A concerned parent Mr James Kale expressed his disappointment to Island Sun yesterday after witnessing several occurrences. “When I question bus conductors why charging, the response is, everyone is paying $3 across the board. “This kind of attitude is a day light robbery and I’m really sorry for these students who pay for $3. “It is pity that children as young as twelve-year-olds are being forced by the crew to pay $3 and $2 bus fare to go to their respective schools,” said Kale. Kale said HCC should take responsibility and make this awareness because the failure lies with relevant authorities such as HCC to monitor bus fare charges. He said that this awareness must carry-out for bus owners, conductors and drivers within Honiara to digested in their minds for not over charging students. Furthermore, he said buses also do not complete their designated route and even charge $3 for short distances. He said that one example is some Buses; charge $3 from White River direct to Rove area.

Foukona Monday, 18 May 2020 Sweeping emergency powers must be used in a manner“reasonably justifiable”, not as an excuse to marginalise opponents. On 25 March, following a government decision, the Solomon Islands Governor General Sir David Vunagi, declared a state of public emergency in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Solomon Islands remains one of a few countries worldwide that is still without a reported case of the novel coronavirus. The Emergency Powers (Covid-19) Regulations 2020 authorised Prime Minster Manasseh Sogavare to make orders to protect the country from the pandemic and to prevent the spread of virus if there were cases. A travel ban was imposed, stopping international flights (except cargo flights), and schools closed. The maritime border with Papua New Guinea between Shortland and Bougainville was also shutdown. The government’s decision to invoke a state of emergency was widely accepted as necessary in order to protect the country from Covid-19. On the face of it, the decision was also in line with the constitution. But there is now an urgent need to examine whether the government has politicised the state of emergency, and whether its behaviour really is constitutional after all. The regulations give the PM the power to make orders to restrict the movement of people, vessels and aircrafts, restrict assembly, suspend the media and declare a public place as emergency zone. These restrictions could infringe people’s fundamental rights, such as the right to movement, free association and freedom of expression as provided for by the constitution. The current government’s position is that the Covid-19 Regulations restrict the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution. However, such restriction is not absolute. As stated under section 16(7) of the constitution: Nothing contained in or done under the authority of any law shall be held to be inconsistent with or in contravention of the [fundamental rights provisions under the constitution] to the extent that the law in question makes in relation to any period of public emergency provision, or authorises the doing during any such period of any thing, that is reasonably justifiable in circumstances of any situation arising or existing during the period for the purpose of dealing with that situation. The High Court of Solomon Islands in Douglas v Attorney General [1999] SBHC 147 explained section 16(7) as follows: “If anything contained in or done under the authority of any law, enacted pursuant to the state of public emergency, is shown not to be reasonably justifiable in the circumstances etc., it may be deemed unconstitutional and invalid.” The key point is the idea that restrictions on fundamental rights must be “reasonably justifiable … for the purpose of dealing with that situation”. The question therefore must be “what is reasonably justifiable” for the purpose of dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic – which is the situation for which the state of public emergency was invoked. Recent events raise serious questions about what is reasonable, and whether the government’s actions are focused foremost on dealing with the pandemic. An example is questions about logging production around the country and phosphate mining in Rennell, which has continued, including with overseas shipments, despite the declaration to keep borders closed. The Bulk Carrier Vessel MV Worship Light was cleared by customs to offload cargo near Honiara despite earlier allegedly violating “international and domestic maritime regulations”. The Western Province Premier, David Lani Gina also questioned why another container ship was allowed to dock at Noro without undergoing a 14-day quarantine as required by the Covid-19 regulations. These are instances of not applying the regulations with potential to undermine the purpose of preventing the spread of the Covid-19 virus. Other cases have also raised questions about what could be “reasonably justified” as related to preventing the spread of the coronavirus. Claude Posala, a senior medical officer who was outspoken on health issues, lost his job on 6 April for having allegedly breached regulation 26 because his social media posts were purportedly “inflammatory against the government”. More recently, the national government threatened to suspend the Malaita Provincial Government (MPG) because the province’s Premier, Daniel Suidani was allegedly making statements against the government’s efforts to fight against Covid-19. This included cautioning the government about obtaining Covid-19 equipment from China. Suidani had earlier drawn the ire of the national government for opposing the diplomatic switch to China last year, yet he has described the latest threats as unsubstantiated and based on misinterpretations of the law. After the opposition leader Matthew Wale cautioned the government not to suspend the MPG “at a time when unity (truncated)",https://www.facebook.com/sundayisles/photos/a.725125640899367/2963944317017477/?type=3,,,,,,,,140,6.36

THE Leader of Opposition, Matthew Wale is calling on the government to explain the real situation with the Chinese vessel that came into the country last week. This call came after it was reported that a Chinese vessel, the MV Worship Light entered Solomon Islands last week and delivered cargo brought in from China under suspicious circumstances. The vessel was said to have carried amongst others, a consignment of medical equipment required for the country’s Covid-19 preparedness activities. It spent four days in Honiara and travelled to two other local destinations before returning to China. According to information at hand, both SIPA and SIMSA banned the vessel from entering for failure to comply with maritime requirements, standards and procedures. In spite of this ban, the vessel was still allowed to enter and berth at a private wharf at Ranadi. This raises a lot of questions of public interest and concerns. It appears as though our international maritime obligations and domestic laws have been broken. Not only was the order by the responsible authorities disobeyed, the vessel was even allowed to berth at a private wharf not controlled by SIPA, and not in the approved wharfs, as per the quarantine requirements. Information at hand also reveal that the vessel’s berthing at the privately owned jetty, was done without SIPA and marine officers involvement, and one wonders how the berthing and offloading activities were handled. Mr Wale stated that, ‘both international and domestic maritime laws apply systems compatible with those of other countries and in times like these, it is of paramount importance that these systems are adhered to and not comprised. Failure to do so can mean black listing of Solomon Islands, something we do not want to happen in our preparedness plans. The decision taken to allow the vessel to enter does not make sense so I question the government on the rationale of this decision and any ramifications expected’. Information received also suggests that the vessel did not undergo the 14-day quarantine period set for foreigners or travelers entering the country in the emergency period. Wale added, ‘it is clear that this vessel came to the Solomon Islands from China and that it spent less than the required days in Honiara. This too appears to be contrary to the quarantine period of 14 days for foreigners entering the country. Again this also casts serious doubts on the government’s seriousness in enforcing the emergency regulations to safeguard the interest of our people’. The opposition group is concerned that given we are still to register a confirmed Covid-19 case, it is incumbent on the government to do everything necessary to prevent the virus from entering our country. While there is so much talk on the beefing up of manpower at the borders to monitor movement of people, this vessel’s questionable entry may have just undermined all these excellent efforts. It also appears as though this is not an isolated incident. There may have been other similar trips in the recent past. While medical equipment is important in our preparedness plans and activities, it is no excuse for allowing a vessel coming from China with Chinese crew to enter the country unchecked. Wale questions the government on how this vessel was allowed to break the emergency quarantine requirements and, whether both crew and cargo were properly inspected on arrival, and what the outcomes of such inspections were. The opposition leader called on the government to ‘clarify the circumstances surrounding the vessel’s trip. The public are entitled to know, the legal authority upon which the vessel was allowed to enter and off load cargo without the responsible authorities, and any steps taken to ensure that the crew and cargo were properly checked before unloading’. The opposition group accepts that the state of emergency is currently in place. But this situation does not mean our laws and established protocols on border entry and shipping laws should be relaxed. In fact the opposite should happen they should be made more stringent, given the situation we are in. That the covid-19 is an imported virus. The sealing of the borders and strict quarantine measures should be our priority. --OPPOSITION PRESS",,,,,,,,,135,1.47

Their fear has heightened with news that the passengers from the China-direct flight will be quarantined at the Hotel. Speaking to the paper, spokesperson for the residents along the eastern side of the hotel’s boundary, says, “we are living in fear because the Institutional Quarantine Facilities (IQF) or Camp Management or any other body dealing with quarantine sites for that matter, have not had the humanity to come and discuss and make us aware of whatever dangers there is to living close to a covid-19 quarantine site. “We have shared our complaint with Island Sun’s management because its office too shares the same fence with the hotel, and we sent a letter of concern to the IQF and they responded telling us to contact the Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS) with our concern. “With the enormity of covid-19 our concern shouldn’t be overlooked by IQF, Camp Management, covid-19 Oversight Committee or the government. We’re human beings and Solomon Islands citizens too.” Nearly 10 households surround the eastern boundary of the hotel. The quarantine rooms are at the eastern wings of the hotel. One room has its wall just less than a metre from the fence which separates the hotel from nearest residence. The closest house to the hotel fence is a about eight metres. This proximity to the hotel is the main factor worrying residents. Furthermore, wildlife such as dogs and cats frequently cross through holes in the fence into the hotel area and back into the residential areas, and since nothing has been assured that covid-19 is not transmissible via wildlife, residents are even more worried. Resident spokesperson adds, “And, we hear that covid-19 is even airborne for a certain time, and with the closeness of the hotel quarantine to our houses, we fear that if any of the quarantined people have the virus, the wind might bring the virus over to us.” King Solomon Hotel was recently used as a quarantine site in early August. It reportedly accommodated individuals including some who came from as far as Panama (Central America). Resident spokesperson told the paper that he even spoke with one of the quarantined persons through the fence during that time. “The man was sitting in the balcony of his room and I was standing near my kitchen, the distance between us was around 10 metres, separated by a wire fence. “And, I asked him where they came from, and the man replied saying Panama. While we talked the man was smoking and flicked his cigarette butt out and it landed on the ground below his room, which is where the dogs and cats normally trod. “Also, we saw some of the quarantined persons toss stuff which could be cigarette butts, left-over food tit-bits, takeaway packages, empty sweet drink tins, beer bottles, etc, etc, and even spit over the balcony onto the ground below. Dogs rummaging below the quarantine rooms would come across these items, and if the virus is present, it would successfully be carried around by the dogs.” It is understood the Ministry of Health (MHMS) is responsible for carrying out awareness regarding the safety around living close to a quarantine centre. Arrangements are reportedly underway to have MHMS do an awareness to the residents. King Solomon Hotel could not be reached for comment before this paper went to print last night.

Matthew Wale described foreign minister Jeremiah Manele’s recent comments against him, as dodgy and misguided. Manele had earlier expressed his disappointment over what he called, a deliberate distortion by the opposition leader of his statement. However, the Opposition Leader pointed out that the Minister is once again trying to dodge the truth behind his earlier statement. “My earlier remarks were intended to condemn the governments ongoing singling out, and punishment of Malaita Province, for taking a principle stand against China; a practice acceptable in any democratic society.” “Malaita's position is the direct result of the government’s deception in not consulting the provinces and people after promising such consultations. “Now with his latest statement focussing on the one China policy, it is clear that his call for unity is really a smoke screen for promoting China’s interest. “It is regrettable that Manele chose to focus on foreign policy than the humanitarian aspects of the understanding between Malaita Province and Taiwan; especially at this time when we are preparing our people for a possible outbreak of the Covid-19.” “Manele is not new to Taiwan and he should know better that its health care system is ranked top in the world hence, any offer of assistance to our people from Taiwan or any reputable health system, at these trying times should be seen as a bonus and should not be politicised,” the Opposition Leader adds. The opposition leader therefore warned the government not to give in too much to Chinese salami-slicing tactics as this could be too divisive for our people. Hon. Wale then called on the Prime Minister to intervene and release the equipment to Malaita province, stressing that the issues raised as grounds for impounding the equipment are petty, compared to the need in Malaita for these.

Speaking during the signing of the Implementation Agreement of the Solomon Islands National University Dormitory project on Friday last week, the Prime Minister said the project is a ‘Win-Win-Win-Win-Win’ project. “This is a 5-win project – a Win for the NHA and PG 2023, a Win for SINU, a Win for our tertiary students, a Win for SIG, and a Win for the Peoples Republic of China,” he said. Prime Minister Sogavare said the NHA when planning for accommodation spaces in 2023 for the Pacific Games came up short of the required accommodation spaces. The Prime Minister said instead of investing in a low-cost accommodation just for the Games, the NHA consulted with SINU and the PRC Embassy and proposed a Dormitory complex that can be used as a Games Village during the Games. “It will have a lasting legacy of gifting to SINU and the people of Solomon Islands a modern dormitory complex that belongs to SINU for its use,” he said. The Prime Minister said the signing marks another milestone in our bilateral relations with the Peoples Republic of China. The 2023 Pacific Games Stadiums project being constructed by CCECC is the single largest capital investment project by PRC in any Pacific country.

The hotel could not withstand the enormous impact caused by the virus that started in Wuhan, China last December after cancellation of bookings by tourists due to lockdown in Australia, Papua New Guinea and Fiji. General Manager, Sanjay Bhargava said the situation was really bad. Bhargava said there is no business as everything closes including accommodation and conferences. He said even some of the long stayers have left to their country due to the virus threats. As such result, Bhargava said the hotel has lost around $3 million since cancellation of bookings in mid-February. “We have laid off 80-100 staff by giving them their last fortnight on March 15. “There is no pay for repatriation and others,” he said. As part of short term measures, Bhargava said there are only 30 staffs doing three shifts working to maintain the services in the restaurant and keep the property. He said the management also control the power usage in the Hotel to cut down on costs. The hotel was opened to the public on August 27, 2009 and it has retained its original structure in the main building. It was during the time the ethnic conflicts had subsided in 2005, Papua New Guinea based business magnate and the current Solomon Islands Trade Commissioner to Papua New Guinea, Sir Kostas Constantinou, dared to venture in to the country with a dream and a business proposal. He had the foresight and the vision that the country would rebuild its infrastructure and would be making strides towards modernity. Tourism being one of the cornerstones in most economies, Solomon Islands would also look towards the sector and this would necessitate a hotel which would be able to meet the demands of the modern traveller. He scouted around for a likely location and would settle for nothing but the one on which the hotel currently stands. The Superannuation fund of Papua New Guinea was also looking for a possible investment in the country and thus became a willing partner. Subsequently the SI Provident Fund came on board the company to one of its most prestigious investments. Commercial operations started in 2009, and six years down the line the Heritage Park Hotel has managed to carve a name for itself in the hospitality sector of the Pacific. However, currently the hotel is facing one of the challenges in business after laying off most of its workers.

Incoming passengers and airport workers have confirmed that up to Sunday, January 26, 2020 there have been no active steps taken by the Ministry of Health in collaboration with other agencies, contrary to their public statements. The coronavirus spreads from human to human, and spreads even when infected persons show no outward symptoms. This makes the task of containing its spread particularly difficult, and Wale calls on the Ministry of Health to urgently seek guidance from the WHO and enter into collaboration with agencies tasked with border protection to do all they can to protect the Solomon Islands public. “This is a very serious public health threat, made even more urgent by the lack of domestic capacity in our healthcare system to care for any infected persons and limit any spread in the country. “It is far better to totally avoid getting any cases in Solomon Islands in the first instance. Marshall Islands has imposed a blanket ban on travelers from China to the country,” the Opposition Leader stressed. Wale is calling on the government to take a similar approach until the virus is brought under control. Whilst attention is placed on arrivals by air, Wale urges the government to also be vigilant with seaborne arrivals. “This country has suffered major biosecurity breaches from log ships and barges that have brought pests into the country. “They are a particularly high risk group that must be closely monitored to ensure they comply with our laws and any measures to protect the country from the Wuhan coronavirus. “The government ought to consider imposing penalties on any carrier, airline, ship-owner, charterer, etc., who fails to comply with the protective measures,” says Wale. He adds that the government must show it is serious about this threat to public health. “So far, beyond words, the public is questioning the lack of action by the government and the lack of urgency in its decision-making on this matter,” the Opposition Leader adds. --OPPOSITION PRESS",,,,,,,,,128,1.39

Matthew Wale cautions the government against the threat to suspend the Malaita Provincial Executive. This call came after it was revealed in the local media that the Minister for Provincial Government and Institutional Strengthening notified Premier Daniel Suidani of the government’s intention to suspend the Malaita Provincial Executive. “I strongly urge the Sogavare government to refrain from taking any decision that is likely to incite social disharmony at a time when the country needs to be united in the face of COVID-19”, said Hon. Wale. He said suspending the Malaita Provincial Executive risks undesirable outcomes that must be avoided, especially when such a decision, on the face of it, seems to be grounded on the selective enforcement of the law. He added that while reasons have been provided, it is hard to ignore the fact that the decision may be directly linked to the stance taken by Malaita Province against the government’s decision to enter into diplomatic ties with China and that those reasons may well be a smokescreen to hide the government’s real intentions. Information at hand suggests that in 2017 under the current PM, the three Premiers from Malaita, Guadalcanal, and Western Provinces took a trip to China as well in response to an invitation by the Friends of China Association, without any approval by the responsible ministry. “The travel by those three Premiers to China did not attract the same punishment that is now being threatened against Malaita Premier and Executive. There was also numerous other such overseas travel by provincial Premiers without approval from the Minister for Provincial Government. Why is Premier Suidani and Malaita being singled out now? “Further, in the recent past, provincial governments were not dissolved by the government even though Auditor General reports uncovered serious mismanagement, including illegal activity that should be grounds warranting suspension,” Hon. Wale pointed out. He further added that “Our country needs all our provinces to pull together now more than ever before, in light of the threat posed by the COVID 19 pandemic. This is not the time to be glorifying any particular foreign partner for assistance provided in our preparedness plans for the COVID-19 if this is what is going on."" “I am concerned that the decision may derail any plans for the people of Malaita province in the government’s overall preparedness plans for the COVID-19. The threat posed by the COVID-19 pandemic affects all our peoples and so politics must not be allowed to stand in the way of our COVID-19 preparedness plans to protect our people’s health and well-being, including those from Malaita Province. “It is important that the government continue to dialogue with the Malaita Provincial government. Malaita must not be excluded from preparedness funding and activities solely because of its policy stance on the China switch decision,” the Opposition Leader stressed. Hon. Wale, therefore, calls on the government to embrace Malaita in a genuine effort to resolve any policy issues, including the possibility of agreeing to disagree on some policy issues. “No policy disagreement should be weighty enough to warrant punitive action against Malaita province,” he said.

Sol 2023 National Hosting Authority Executive Director Mr Christian Nieng told SunSPORTS, however says a specific date for the ceremony is yet to be confirmed. He said that all designs concepts for the projects have already been approved by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) government after the visit of the CSADI team. The Central-South Architectural Design Institute (CSADI) team are responsible for the design of the 2023 Pacific Games Projects. The team had left the country late last year after a brief visit. “Yes (designs are approved). Awaiting PRC’s contractors to come and build as of May this year. Ground breaking will be in April. Date to be confirmed,” Mr Nieng stated. Minister responsible to deliver the 2023 Pacific Games, Honourable Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare last month had said he is confident of delivering the games on time, adding all construction jobs have either been awarded or awaiting completion of tendering processes and are on schedule to commence this year. Solomon Islands and China on April 14th 2020, had signed an USD 100m agreement that will see PRC fund 80 percent of the facilities for the 2023 Pacific Games. The USD100m will financially cover the 11,000-capacity main national sports stadium, an aquatic centre, tennis centre, a hockey field, a multi –purpose hall and an office administration block to hub local sporting federations during the games. Charge De Affairs of China to Solomon Islands, His Excellency Mr Yao Ming had said the 2023 PG stadium project is a symbol of friendship between China and Solomon Island sand that, it is a symbol of national pride for Solomon Islands government and the people. “A lot of the 2023 Pacific Games Facilities Projects had been delayed due to COVID 19 pandemic, nevertheless my government and our bilateral partners are determined to deliver all the facilities in time for the 17th Pacific Games that will be held in Solomon Islands in 2023,” the Prime Minister had said. “This would not have been possible if the government of Solomon Islands did not enter into historical partnership with the government of the Republic of Indonesia and the government of the People’s Republic of China, both being key donors of the 2023 Pacific Games Facilities,” Hon. Sogavare adds. The national government together with the Indonesia government had already held the ground breaking ceremony for the Indonesia government funded Multipurpose Hall futsal stadium on December 21st 2020.

THERE is but one China in the world. Taiwan is an inalienable part of China's territory. The government of the People's Republic of China is the sole legal government that represents the whole of China. The UN General Assembly Resolution 2758, which recognizes the above basic facts and universal consensus of the world at large, has provided a solid legal foundation for the international community to handle Taiwan-related issues in accordance with the one-China principle. The Taiwan question involves China's core interests, the People's Republic of China has no room for compromise in this regard. The one-China principle is political basis for PRC to establish and develop diplomatic relations with any other country in the world. On the basis of the one-China principle, PRC and Solomon Islands established diplomatic relations on September 21, 2019. 2. It is noted with deep concern that leaders of the Malaita provincial government have recently made irresponsible remarks and actions against the one-China policy adopted by the Solomon Islands national government. The provincial leaders brought undue attention to the Taiwan question by alluding to Taiwan as the so-called “Republic of China” and displaying the so-called “national flag” of Taiwan in public. All these words and acts ran counter to the one-China policy committed to by the Solomon Islands government and international community. The claims and actions by the Malaita provincial leaders are illegitimate, inappropriate and entirely wrong. It breaches the sovereignty and territorial integrity of China and hurts the national feelings of the Chinese people. 3. Last September in Beijing, Hon. Jeremiah Manele, Minister of Foreign Affairs and External Trade of Solomon Islands signed the Joint Communique on the establishment of diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and Solomon Islands on the basis of the one-China principle. Last October, Hon. Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare, while paying his first official visit to PRC, reiterated that the Solomon Islands government would firmly adhere to the one-China principle. China highly commends commitments made by the Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs and External Trade of Solomon Islands on following the one-China policy. On 10 June 2020, Hon. Minister Manele made a solemn statement, making it clear that Taiwan is an integral part of the People’s Republic of China’s territory, refuting Premier Suidani’s provocative words when the Premier purportedly made wrong reference to Taiwan region as a state rather than an integral part of the People’s Republic of China. It is well noted and highly appreciated that Hon. Minister Manele, on behalf of the Solomon Islands government, has resolutely reaffirmed Solomon Island’s one-China policy in public. One-China principle should be honored in a strict manner by Solomon Islands national as well as provincial governments. It is urged that the Solomon Islands side concerned strictly abide by the one-China principle, respect China’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, stop making irresponsible remarks or actions against the one-China principle, refrain from official contacts in any form with Taiwan, properly handle Taiwan-related issues and avoid causing disturbances to the relationship between the People’s Republic of China and Solomon Islands.

He adds that it is important to keep in mind that determining the cause of the riots is only one of the terms or issues for consideration. He said there is no guarantee that an inquiry will get the right results. “There are however, many other questions, which may need to be considered. For example, the role of the RSIPF, in preventing crime, protecting life and property, maintaining peace, law and order in the streets, may form an integral part of the enquiry. “If we talk about providing the RSIPF with the right equipment and arms in their policing duties, then may be such an enquiry will help to identify these instead of being presumptive about them. This is not the first time China Town has been unlawfully encroached upon. “If I remember correctly, I think this is the third time this has happened. Surely there must be some important lessons to be learned, if we wish to ensure that there is not a repeat in the future. “There is no question in our minds (no doubt), that China town is going to be rebuilt, the question in everyone’s mind however, is whether there is any assurance that the safety and security for that part of the town will be guaranteed,” Sir Albert said. He said there are key persons or groups that may need to be given opportunity to be heard, such as the Victims, the Chinese Community, the Business Community, Churches, Provincial Government leaders, in particular those from Guadalcanal and Malaita, Honiara City Council, Women and Youth group leaders, and the list goes on. Sir Albert highlighted that out of such an enquiry if done well, meaningful, helpful and practical solutions or suggestions may be made for the future safety, security and protection of that important business part of the city. “I think the wisdom or take-home message from these, is that unless we learn (important lessons) from our past, we are bound to repeat them, and next time it may be worse,” Sir Albert added. 📷 Chief Justice Sir Albert Palmer.

MRD Permanent Secretary (PS) Allan Daonga stated in the statement that his ministry has administered disbursements of the funds early this week with constituencies receiving SBD$1.8 million each. He said PRC support for this year (2021) focuses mainly on three components which include; community social infrastructures, water supply & sanitation and income generating initiatives to improve rural livelihoods. “I believe the funds will go down to the core of the rural areas and will improve the life of Solomon Islanders living in the rural communities.” Meanwhile, Mr. Daonga expressed appreciation on behalf of the Solomon Islands Government and its people to the Government of People’s Republic of China (PRC) and its tax payers for their ongoing support towards this program.

Wale said the Foreign Minister should focus his efforts on foreign affairs and our international relations. There are other ministers who are responsible for internal governance matters. Further, Hon. Wale said, during Solomon Islands’ diplomatic relations with the Republic of China, Taiwan, Guadalcanal established and enjoyed productive relations with Guangdong Province as proxy for the PRC. He said successive governments respected Guadalcanal provinces decision to enter into that relationship. Why is Malaita being targeted by this government?” Hon. Wale questioned. “In many countries in the region and around the world, provinces and states are permitted to pursue relations with foreign states and governments to pursue their interests. “The government needs to be open-minded on this matter and encourage all provinces to seek such relationships. “Hon. Manele cannot continue to ostracize Malaita province on the government’s decision on recognizing PRC,” said Hon. Wale. The Opposition Leader goes on to add that, “A more embracive approach needs to be taken. Malaita province’s grievance continues to be that the government failed in its promise and did not consult it on the decision.

The MOU was signed by Prime Minister Hon Manasseh Sogavare, Minister of Commerce, Industries, Labour and Immigration (MCILI), Hon Elijah Clezy Rore, SICCI Chair, Jay Bartlett and witnessed by MCILI Permanent Secretary, Riley Mesepitu and the SICCI Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Ms Atenasi Ata. The signing ceremony coincided with the launch of the country’s ‘Iumi Tugeda’ Campaign at the National Museum Auditorium in Honiara. “The re-signing of this MoU is again another significant milestone in strengthening the relationship between our Government and Business leaders,” SICCI Chair, Mr Bartlett, said. “This MoU re-establishes a formal, structured public private dialogue mechanism that should allow us to arrive at an agreed position on reform priorities and to develop innovative solutions and policies that are in step with the ever changing domestic, regional and global landscape,” he added. Mr Bartlett said the MoU platform will be the focus for SICCI for the next twenty-four (24) months and on that note sincerely thanked the SICCI Secretariat, members and affiliates for the continued support to the SICCI Board and its vision to focus on such a framework. It was reiterated at Wednesday’s gathering of high-level Government delegation, private sector and development partners that the Solomon Islands’ Government priority is to ensure that the country maintains economic stability, remains safe and continues to progress despite the current COVID-19 situation. To achieve these priority objectives, the Democratic Coalition Government for Advancement (DCGA) is currently in the process of redirecting our policies to focus on investing into and firmly establishing the fundamental pillars of development based on inclusivity and meaningful participation that will also provide a catalyst for socio-economic growth in strategically targeted sectors. As such, Prime Minister Hon Manasseh Sogavare said Government’s partnership with the private sector is of unparalleled importance. Hon Sogavare maintained that his Government will continue to work together with SICCI, as the peak body representing private sector in Solomon Islands, to drive the country forward during these unprecedented times. “This partnership with SICCI was forged back in 6th July 2017 when a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between myself as the Prime Minister, the Minister of Commerce, Industry, Labour and Immigration and the Chairman of SICCI. “This partnership has provided a platform for policy discussions and for both parties to explore new ways and ideas of doing business across both sectors, and I must say what better time to explore new ways and ideas then now, during the ‘new normal’,” the Prime Minister said. The partnership with Government also gave rise to other initiatives, which includes SICCI to be consulted in pre-budget meetings, provide inputs to infrastructure development, minimum wage discussions, and being involved in other areas of mutual interest, such as the undersea cable project. The Democratic Coalition Government for Advancement 100 days policy was also launched during the Prime Minister’s Breakfast, an annual event hosted by SICCI, which was also an initiative of this partnership. “During my first state visit to People’s Republic of China I was also accompanied by members of SICCI as well. This is a reflection of the esteem that this Government holds for SICCI. “As such, it gives me great pleasure to announce that this partnership will be renewed today (Wednesday 15 July, 2020) with the signing of another Memorandum of Understanding. “This partnership is the ultimate manifestation of our campaign, ‘Iumi Tugeda’,” the Prime Minister said. Mr Bartlett, on behalf of the SICCI Board and members, thank the Government for placing value on the relationship with SICCI and agreeing to resign this MoU. “I would especially like to acknowledge our Honorable Prime Minister for playing a key role in ensuring that this has become a reality and by personally putting pen to paper once again. This is the true spirit of unity we share,” the SICCI Chair, Mr Bartlett, said. An initial two-year MoU was signed between SICCI and Government in July 2017 critical in providing a platform for policy dialogue. A SIG – Private Sector Advisory Group was established to accommodate these discussions between SIG officials from core Ministries and private sector representatives from SICCI on a quarterly basis. Through the Advisory Group, the Government and the private sector will work towards exploring solutions that a tailor-fit to Solomon (truncated)",https://www.facebook.com/theIslandSunNews/photos/a.1945000505830465/2545499689113874/?type=3,,,Photos from The Island Sun News's post,,,,,115,-1.43

Solomon Islands Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said the diplomatic switch to Beijing had been the “right thing to do” and put the archipelago of about 690,000 people on the “right side of history”. “Today marks a new era of relations that signifies the permanent friendship of the People’s Republic of China and the Solomon Islands, as co-members of the United Nations,” local media reported Sogavare saying on Monday during an opening ceremony in the capital Honiara. “It involved correcting the mistakes of the past and respecting each other’s territorial boundaries.” Li Ming, the new Chinese ambassador, said Beijing’s establishment of ties with the country, which lies about 1,800km (1,118 miles) east of Papua New Guinea, conformed to “the trend of the times and benefits the two peoples”. At the same moment about 100km away – authorities in Malaita, the most populous of the country’s nine provinces – were in the middle of preparations for an independence referendum fuelled by growing suspicion and acrimony towards China. The planned vote, which Malaita’s Premier Daniel Suidani says could take place within weeks, marks the culmination of a long-running bitter feud between provincial and central authorities related to government representation and lagging development. Honiara’s ties with Beijing and its embrace of Chinese investors have further aggravated these divisions. The ructions – occurring as they have amid growing competition for influence in the Pacific between China and the United States with its allies – highlight the difficulties facing outside powers who wish to win friends and exert influence in Pacific Island nations with complex histories and internal politics. “Malaita independence has always been simmering but the national government’s perceived disregard of Malaita’s, and to a greater extent the nation’s, voice on the switch would have played a big part in pushing Malaita towards looking more seriously at independence,” said Peter Kenilorea Jnr, one of the nation’s opposition MPs. The nation’s switch of allegiance in September last year sparked an immediate backlash in Malaita, which is home to about one-quarter of the population but remains chronically underdeveloped compared to the neighbouring island of Guadalcanal where the capital is located. Malaitan officials complained that they had not been consulted. They pointed to how China’s lack of democracy, suppression of Christianity and allegations it has engaged in debt trap diplomacy did not gel with the aspirations of its residents, which were laid out in a communique issued last October. Malaita’s Premier Daniel Suidani, who has vowed to oppose any loans or investment from China, has accused government MPs of trying to bribe him into accepting the switch. When that failed, he claimed ex-militants from the country’s 1998–2003 ethnic conflict were sent to the province for the purposes of intimidation. Tensions came to a head earlier this month over a chartered flight from Guangzhou. Although billed as a repatriation flight, only 21 of the 104 passengers on board were Solomon Islanders. The rest were Chinese embassy staff and workers involved in the construction of venues for the 2023 Pacific Games, according to a passenger list obtained by Radio New Zealand. Despite assurances from the central government in Honiara that all passengers would have to test negative for Covid-19 and then undergo quarantines, the flight sparked outrage in the Solomon Islands, which has so far had no cases of the virus. Two days before the flight touched down on September 3, Suidani promised to give people in his province a chance to vote on whether they wanted to be part of a country whose “leadership is becoming dictatorial”. “People are of the view that the government is more supportive of Chinese,” said Celsus Talifilu, an adviser to Suidani. “Not only that but I think there is a current perception amongst many people in the Solomons that the government has been bought by China, although it is very difficult to ascertain any evidence.” Talifilu said the referendum would be a survey of people’s views and could lead to the introduction of arrangements that, while falling short of full-fledged independence, would see the province “independently manage some of its affairs”. “It depends on how the negotiations happen,” he said, adding that he expected the vote to take place by next month. “From the Malaita perspective, it’s not going to be an easy one.” Even before the controversial switch of allegiance, Malaita had a history of turbulent relations with the country’s central authorities, with several of the province’s premiers raising the possibility of independence over the last two decades.

No explanation has been given by government for its sudden change of heart. The medical kits are reportedly under Premier Daniel Suidani’s care, and are expected to be brought over to Auki today. Mr Celsius Talifilu, an advisor to the Malaita Premier, announced via facebook the equipment’s release, saying: “Premier Suidani today (Tuesday) took possession of the Taiwanese humanitarian donated COVID equipment that was confiscated by the police. “We were informed that the DPP office have authorised the released of the equipment. “No further information was provided. We understand that the police has made investgation on the items. “However, it seemed that there are no illegal issues concerning the importation of the equipment.” The equipment’s release also fulfills deputy prime minister Manasseh Maelanga’s assurance to the Malaitan people and government that the impounded kits would be released “soon”. On Friday last week, in his speech addressing the province during the celebration of the 37th Malaita Day, Mr Maelanga made the surprising announcement. “I want to let you know my good people of Malaita that you might say to us Malaitan MPs in government side to try our best to release the PPEs. “I want to tell you that these things are now ready to be released soon,” Maelanga said, in his speech. Talifilu posts on facebook: “Sure enough, the PARU [Provincial Advisory Reform Unit] office was contacted by Customs an hour after that announcement to pick the goods.” He adds that Malaita’s provincial government thanks Taiwan for the generous life-saving gifts. The covid-19 equipment was confiscated on June 16 by government citing “suspicious nature surrounding the importation of the cargoes”. The cargo was the second batch of covid-19 equipment donated by Taiwan under its global counter-covid19 programme, which was offered to any country including those which do not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan. This infamous move by government to impound the humanitarian aid has been widely criticised as a direct display of Beijing’s stooge oblivious of the welfare of the people of Malaita against the current covid-19 pandemic. Malaita declared following the seizure that it had sought assistance from our former ally, Republic of China (Taiwan), to help the province prepare itself for any possible covid-19 entry.",,,,,,,,,113,1.23

In a strongly worded statement yesterday, the Chinese embassy in Honiara also held the Royal Solomon Islands police to their words that they will catch the “culprit”. On the morning of Tuesday, April 13, a Chinese business woman was reportedly killed while she was opening up her shop at the White Angel building, in the heart of Point Cruz. As of late, police do not have any suspect and are still to make any arrest although they reportedly have a few leads. The sympathetic but stern Embassy statement says: “On April 18, Chinese Embassy consular officers, together with Chinese Association and other Chinese community organizations in Solomon Islands, extended deep condolences to family of the deceased member of Chinese community at a traditional mourning at the residence of the deceased. “The Chinese Embassy strongly condemned the brutal and cold-blood killing and will continue to provide necessary consular support to Chinese citizens in the family and Chinese communities as a whole. “The Chinese Embassy has also attended briefings by RSIPF officers to Chinese Community. “RSIPF reiterated that the culprit will be brought to justice, law & order can be maintained and investment environment in Solomon Islands is safe.” Meanwhile, last week’s killing sparked the country to rise up and condemn such inhuman acts; national government, Honiara city council (HCC), the Chambers Commerce (SICCI) and other authorities spoke out. In social media many Solomon Islanders both in country and abroad denounced the killing, conveying condolences to the deceased’s family and the Chinese community, which one commentator described last week as “one of the main pillars of our economy”.",,,,,,,,,112,1.22

This was confirmed to Island Sun yesterday in a press statement. The Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS) was responding to rumours on social media that two positive cases are being monitored at the national referral hospital. Refuting this rumour MHMS says public should refrain from creating false talks which would cause unnecessary panic or false alarm. MHMS however says that it is closely monitoring the situation and working closely with stakeholders and partners to ensure possible protection to any importation of the Coronavirus (2019 –nCov) into the country. The Health Emergency Operation Committee (HEOC) has been activated after a briefing with the National Disaster Operation Committee (NDOC) of Health and all health clusters are now tasked with different responsibilities. The activation of HEOC has called on all sectors and departments within health and outside of health for operational actions to be done on the novel coronavirus situation. The MHMS requests that proper coordination of activities and delegation of tasks and responsibilities are in place. The virus is spread through close contact with those infected, and specifically through the saliva or mucus of an infected person, and warning all citizens and residents to avoid touching anyone who shows any resipiratory symptoms. Coronavirus, which was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan, has killed more than 100 plus people and infected thousand others. The outbreak is believed to be the result of the consumption of a pathogen usually found in wild animals. Exotic animals are commonly found in markets in China, where their meat is sold for food or traditional medicines. The lethal virus has spread to countries outside of China, including the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, Vietnam, and France.

The virus is now present in the majority of nations and territories on Earth, with over 140,000 cases confirmed. As of 5pm today, Fiji does not have a confirmed case of COVID-19. We should all be grateful for the diligence and vigilance of those on the ground working to buy us vital time to prepare. We must take advantage of this precious time we have been blessed with by acting now to reduce the chance of this virus spreading when it arrives in Fiji. Our travel restrictions on Italy, Iran, South Korea and mainland China remain in full effect, as do the stringent screening measures at our international airports. We plan to install thermal scanners at our international airports. From tomorrow, cruise ships will be banned from berthing anywhere in Fiji. Also from tomorrow, international events will not be allowed in Fiji and local events will be closed to all guests coming in from overseas. Ministers, civil servants, Permanent Secretaries and staff of statutory bodies will be restricted from travelling overseas barring exceptionally critical circumstances. We also highly discourage all Fijians from travelling overseas. If you do choose to travel anywhere outside of Fiji, you may be required to self-isolate for 14 days upon your return to Fiji, even if you are not displaying symptoms of COVID-19. This, of course, is already mandated for Fijians arriving home from nations on our restricted travel list. These measures will all be subject to review as the global situation evolves. We already have secure isolation facilities up and running throughout Fiji, with the Central Division being served by Navua Hospital, the Western Division served by the Nadi Hospital, and Labasa Hospital serving the Northern Division. As we monitor the situation, more isolation units will be established as the need arises in accordance with our expansion plan. As of the 15th of March at 5pm, Fiji remains coronavirus-free –– and it is on that basis that we’ve developed these measures. If and when we see our first case, far more stringent measures will immediately come into effect to aggressively prevent the spread of the disease, as other nations have done, such as bans on local gatherings. While we may not yet have a case, now is the time to begin changing the ways we go about our day-to-day lives to strengthen our resilience to an outbreak. The single most important thing anyone can do is to wash your hands with soap and water on a regular basis. The combination of soap and water kills COVID-19 dead in its tracks. I’m asking everyone watching to help me carry that message to every man, woman and child in Fiji. Thorough and effective handwashing takes 20 seconds –– and with this simple act, you may very well be saving a life. We’ll also need to break the habit of shaking hands, hugging and sharing takis and bilos. Instead, simply share a “bula” from a safe distance and limit in-person contact as much as possible. This isn’t just about protecting yourself, this is about responsibility –– your responsibility to the well-being of the countless Fijians who you cross paths with every day. Do it to protect the elderly woman you walk by at the market, the man with a pre-existing heart condition who rides the bus with you, or the grandparent who you look after. While the steps we can take as individuals are critical, to be effective, the preparations for COVID-19 must be society-wide. We need everyone aware of the risks and actively participating in our national response. Because the sobering reality is that, while we have yet to see a case in our country, our population is already vulnerable to coronavirus. Those with preexisting conditions and NCDs –– like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer –– are at a higher risk of death by COVID-19. So, I encourage all Fijians to use this moment to make lasting lifestyle changes to improve your health –– by doing so, you are guarding yourself and those you love from communicable viruses, like COVID-19, and non-communicable disease alike. To maximise our larger prevention and containment efforts, we’ll continue to work closely with our hotel and tourism partners to help identify, isolate and treat any visitors who may be experiencing symptoms of the virus. With our flows of tourism under close supervision, we will continue supporting the tens of thousands of Fijian families who depend on the tourism sector for their livelihoods. As we work hand-in-hand with our tourism operators and other business leaders to combat the coronavirus, we hear their very serious worries about the impact the situation will have on their business. As the outbreak worsens and travel restrictions heighten, people are travelling less. Supply chains as well are seeing (truncated)",https://www.facebook.com/thefijitimes/videos/816841478793156/,,,,,,,,108,-2.27

In Solomon Islands, the rollout of China’s multi-billion dollar infrastructure package has been severely affected in terms of delays, pushing back start-up dates by two months or more. Exchange visits by senior officials from both sides – initially planned for February - have also been delayed. These visits have now been rescheduled to take place next month, including a visit to China by the Minister of Health and Medical Services, Dickson Mua, to sign an MOU on medical cooperation between Solomon Islands and China. The World Health Organization (WHO) this week declared the Coronavirus outbreak, which began last December, a pandemic. The delays in rolling out its aid program have not deterred Chinese officials in prioritizing infrastructure projects being earmarked for construction as soon as Solomon Islands ease travel entry restrictions on individuals who come from countries with cases of the disease. Of the initial five projects agreed by Beijing last October, the two sides have identified three which have been given top priority. They are the National Referral Hospital, the 2023 Pacific Games and the new water supply system for Honiara. China has also made allowances to shorten the process in picking the winning bid for each of the project by half. The selection process for the winning bid normally takes up to six months. Now China plans to halve the time. Meanwhile the economic impact from the coronavirus outbreak is being felt in other sectors. There are reports the airlines industry has been hard hit with unconfirmed reports the national carrier was unable to pay its staff. “The Airline’s CEO has to fork out about $1 million of his own money to pay staff wages,” according to unconfirmed reports. The report is exacerbated by plans to terminate the Brisbane-Munda weekend flight due to lack of tourist numbers. In the logging industry it is reported that monthly shipments of round logs has fallen to just six in the last three months. A few months ago, there were 13 shipments a month.",,,,,,,,,67,-1.37

This is because ‘four’ passengers were prohibited to board due to non-compliance to Solomon Islands pre-arrival mandatory testing requirements and protocols. Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare in his nationwide address yesterday said this is how serious the Government is with testing protocols as no one will be allowed regardless of their status or nationality to board a flight if he or she does not meet the pre-arrival mandatory testing requirements and protocols. It is understood that all 104 passengers that arrived from Guangzhou, China, since arrival have been quarantined at their designated quarantine stations under strict conditions. “That said, all passengers that arrived last week had at least two covid-19 tests prior to boarding and departure. All their results are negative,” said Sogavare. “All 104 passengers were thoroughly checked by health frontline workers upon arrival at the Henderson Airport and were all cleared to proceed to their designated quarantine stations. “All will undergo required period of quarantine until deemed safe to be released and will be tested periodically. First test have already been conducted within 48 hours of their arrival in accordance with testing procedure. Testing apart, they are still undergoing rigorous health checks during quarantine. My good people, the Government will continue to update our people on the progress and status of these passengers as they serve their quarantine days.” The Prime Minister assures the people of this nation that the Government remains committed and vigilant in the fight against covid-19. “My good people, this Government remain committed and vigilant in our fight against covid-19. “We should be thankful that Solomon Islands still maintain its covid-19 free status, and we remain amongst the few nations world-wide that have yet to record a positive case. “Fellow citizens, despite the criticisms, our determination is stronger than ever and our resolve has never wavered. “This Government will continue to take drastic and proactive measures to protect our citizens while at the same time keeping our economy afloat,” said Sogavare.",,,,,,,,,104,1.13

PM Sogavare accused Wale of breaching Parliamentary privileges when he made statements in the Public Accounts Committee recently and in Auki, Malaita that the Government and Attorney General were anti-Malaita. This was in relation to the move by Ministry of Provincial Government and Institutional Strengthening (MPGIS) to suspend Malaita Province for opposing the switch to Peoples Republic of China (PRC) and blocked the PPE equipment donated by Republic of China (Taiwan). Government had already sorted out the issue with Malaita Province and released the PPE after the province’s Second Appoint Day. Sogavare told Parliament yesterday that Wale raised the issue against the Government and Attorney General Office when the permanent secretary of MPGIS appeared before the Public Accounts Committee for the scrutiny of the 2020 Supplementary Appropriation Bill 2020 recently and in Auki. “It shows there are anti-Malaita feelings in government. “These statements are baseless accusations, designed to incite the Malaita people to rise up against the government. I could not think of any other reasons,” he said. Sogavare said Wale made similar comments in Auki last year when he led MPs from other side. “He (Wale) asked people at Auki market to board a ship and go up. “These statements not made in isolation, actually a strategy in part of Opposition to destabilise this government. Everyone knows they cannot throw the government in legal means,” he added. In his ruling, Speaker Patterson Oti said the comments made in PAC affects Parliament’s privileges but not the statements made in Auki.

The Premier’s Political Advisor, Celsus Talifilu posted this on social media that the move is being made so that China can enter Malaita and force it to submit. Talifilu alleged that Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare has sent DPM Maelanga with orders and a big amount of Chinese money to ensure this happens as soon as possible to allow Chinese takeover. He said some Government members of Parliament from Honiara had informed Auki that Maelanga is on a mission to bribe MPAs for a no-confidence motion on Premier Suidani. However, Maelanga told Island Sun that he was shocked to learn of the allegations. “Rubbish,” he retorted when asked about the allegation. “I never visit Auki Township upon arrival but travel straight to my constituency in East Malaita from Gwounaru’u airport,” he said. The Deputy Prime Minister yesterday met with the Council, which consists of various leaders of the communities in the constituency. Maelanga will hand over school materials to Foumamanu Community High School today and visit the deteriorating roads in East Malaita following the recent rainfall. He is expected to arrive in Honiara on Friday. Earlier, Premier Suidani said his camp was rock solid because the population in Malaita is backing them. Suidani said this was evident when the Ministry of Provincial Government and Institutional Strengthening wanted to recall Provincial Secretary Fredrick Fa’abasua and it led to protests in Auki. “How much more if the Premier is removed?” he said. Suidani said the proposed motion of no confidence planned against him died its natural death because the Malaita population is behind MARA government. He said is government’s numerical strength will be back to normal after other MPAs are expected to arrive from Malaita Outer Islands yesterday. There are 33 wards in Malaita. Speaker of Malaita Provincial Assembly, Ronnie Butala said his office has not received any notice of motion of no confidence.",,,,,,,,,102,1.11

Makili said the outbreak and current status of the virus has caused flight restrictions which also cause challenges for the Solomon Islands citizens especially those traveling on business tour who are now stranded. He said the most supportive neighbouring countries like Australia and New Zealand have already on to their planning strategy on evacuating their citizens out from China. “Their planning involves the set-up of quarantine processes for the citizens as part of the evacuation process,” he said. He said close neighbour PNG sought assistance from Aussie and New Zealand and were also supported as well as Fiji.

In a media statement yesterday, Malaita provincial government says, “Essential humanitarian medical equipment bound for Malaita to fight covid-19 was reportedly seized by police on Thursday. In a secret action, the equipment was seized from customs without warrant or explanation despite the fact that the import duty was paid and cleared by the Customs and Exercise Division. When customs officers sought legal basis for this, none was given and the equipment was taken away by the Police. The equipment was donated on humanitarian grounds by Republic of China and shipped to a Malaitan person who was going to donate them to Malaita Province. MARA Government calls on the Commissioner of Police and Attorney General to explain what legal basis was used to hold up this life saving equipment. The equipment included one set of Thermal Image Camera plus monitor and 2 Thermal temperature cameras to check people for fevers on entry to Malaita, and was specifically donated to assist with fighting covid-19. This appears to be a direct action against the fight of covid-19 in Malaita the most populated province of Solomon Islands. It is also an action that is contrary to the purpose for which a State of Public Emergency is declared. “We would like to know: Why is lifesaving equipment for Malaita held up when it is to fight covid-19? We know that a whole range of limitations to Constitutional Rights and Freedoms have been put on the people of Solomon Islands in the name of covid-19, including closing of boarders. However, exemptions have been made for the arrival of supplies from PRC and others. But when there is covid-19 equipment donated to Malaita, the DCGA based on advice from the AG has ordered the Police to seize it. This looks like it is an action against the public health of Malaitans, and against the justifiable purpose of the State of Public Emergency. The Malaita Provincial Government would like to see that the Commissioner of Police and the Attorney General quickly resolve this matter so as to ensure the equipment are freed.",,,,,,,,,98,1.07

This statement was made following the Opposition leader’s publication in today’s paper. The Solomon Islands Government is appalled by the comments of the Leader of Official Opposition. A statement from the Solomon Islands Government said, “this is the first time, a Leader of the Official Opposition and a very senior Member of Parliament, openly advocates for a breach of our laws in which as a legislator, he should instead be protecting and advocating for strict compliance.” “It must be noted that the letter by the Minister for Provincial Government and Institutional Strengthening (MPGIS) to the Malaita Premier is an internal matter by virtue of the Provincial Government Act 1997 and does not constitute any political motivations to suspend the Provincial Government.” “Hon. Wale knows that by law, all Provincial Governments are required to act in a manner that complies with the Provincial Government Act 1997 and Malaita Provincial Government is no exception,” the statement added. By promoting and inducing a contravention of an Act, such actions are bordering as a criminal offence including sedition and this is a matter for Police to investigate. Hon. Wale was ultimately advocating for all Provincial Governments to disregard legal obligations and expects the national Government to turn a blind eye. The Statement clarifies that the Minister’s letter to the Premier of Malaita Province is an internal matter, which outlines the various contraventions of the Premier and advising the Hon. Premier to take corrective measures in regards to compliance with the PGA 1997. The MPGIS Minister also advised that non-alignment of the Premier’s action to the National Government’s preparedness and emergency response priorities, potentially undermines public order and poses a risk to our national security with regards to the fight against COVID19 which requires intervention of the National Government. Non-compliance and breaches to the Provincial Government Act can result in consequences that includes the suspension of the Provincial Government under the Provincial Government Act. This is a matter of the application of law and not politics. The letter does not in any way call for a suspension of the Malaita Provincial Government and that must be made clear. It is unfortunate that certain media elements and the opposition leader are treating the matter as if the Malaita Provincial Government will be suspended or dissolved any moment from now. Mr. Wale’s outburst and wrongful assertion to the media releases is provocative, speculative and does not reflect well on him as a senior leader. Mr. Wale has quickly jumped to conclusions and rhetorically came up with irrational theories and ideologies that are designed to create disharmony and confusion in our communities. More so to provoke animosity against the Government during this critical state of emergency period to safeguard our nation from the threat of COVID-19. The Emergency Powers (COVID-19) Regulations creates offences for such publications and as stated above, will be a matter for Police to investigate. Further, in the call for the recent Premiers meeting, the Honorable Minister expected all Premiers to attend this important meeting in Honiara. The matter was to discuss measures concerning Government’s preparedness and responsiveness to the COVID-19 pandemic. Whilst, all Premiers attended, the Malaita Premier failed to attend citing attendance at an awareness program at his ward/community and therefore sending only his Deputy, however, he apparently arrived in Honiara the following day after the closing of the Premiers’ meeting. In a matter of significant national interest, it is expected that all commitments by all Premiers are to be set aside and their attendance as being paramount to the national interest. The Minister’s letter also called for dialogue with Provincial Governments. After the completion of the Premiers meeting in 23rd of April 2020, the minister also sent over through a circular on the limitations of powers, responsibility and expectations from the Provinces in the joint fight against the spread of the COVID-19. The Minister continuous to call for support in this regard from the provinces. It is surprising that the opposition leader continues to look for issues to arouse fear and resentment among members of the Public. The statement further added that the Hon. Opposition leader need to validate his sources firstly before misleading and spreading lies to the public at large. Hon. Wale stated in his media statement that in 2017 former Premiers of Guadalcanal, Malaita and Western Province did not obtain permission before taking overseas trips.

In its media statement yesterday, the democratic coalition government for advancement (DCGA) said it is “fully committed to ensure that all constituencies in the country benefit from the Rural Constituency Development Fund (RCDF).” DCGA claims that it will not allow politics to get in the way of its commitment to “serve the best interest of all citizens of this nation”. Although DCGA is shying away from directly answering the question of what would happen to the five Malaitan constituencies it has blocked, it holds up its “leave no one behind” motto, which indicates that it may have other plans for these five. DCGA says it “believes and stands by its moral values and obligation to execute the RCDF program to ensure people from all our constituencies benefit”. “The government is now exploring how best to ensure the RCDF for the five remaining constituencies can be channelled to address the development needs and aspirations of the people in these constituencies.” On Tuesday, December 3, Caucus decided to block Aoke-Langalanga, East and West Are’are, Small Malaita and Central Kwaraae constituencies from receiving 30 percent of the total RCDF, which is the portion funded by communist China. The other 70 percent is footed by our taxpayers. This action by government is reportedly to “punish” these five constituencies for supporting the Malaita provincial government in its adamant stand against DCGA and its pro-China agenda. Public has since then been shaking their heads over this quite unprecedented move by government, many labeling it as a signature of a communist regime. Members of the opposition group have also appealed to national government to re-think its “childish” and “immoral” decision. DCGA’s latest response is vague on how the five constituencies will receive fundings. In DCGA’s media statement, it speaks on behalf of the government of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), saying that PRC “wishes to ensure its support to Solomon Islands reaches all our people”.",,,,,,,,,96,1.04

A spokesperson from the Solomon Islands National Council of Women on behalf of the CSO leaders attending the meeting, said, that they have noted the action by the Minister in his official capacity as serious, violating the Public Finance Act of Solomon Islands. CSO Leaders also felt that his action is a breach of his Oath of Allegiance as Minister of the Crown, not been loyal to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, and in performing his duties of not protecting and serving the interest of Solomon Islands Citizens and the nation. CSO Leaders kindly requested the Minister to apologize to the nation on behalf of the DCGA Government because of the intended cause of action he took with the Broker by the name of Mr. Wong, to deal with few Businessmen in China for the purpose of lending to the Solomon Islands Government the total sum of $100USD Billion. This is a total breach of his Oath and Allegiance and therefore, should do the right thing by apologizing to the nation. Solomon Islands as a sovereign nation must follow protocols in dealing with such serious loan matters on government to government basis and not using middlemen with a predetermined 11% heavy interest fee, which will benefit only a few cronies to become Billionaires overnight if the Loan proposal is to be materialized. The Solomon Islands Government does not have the capacity to mortgage such a huge loan, and therefore will commit all Solomon Islands individual citizen, tribal land with its minerals and sea resources thus setting a new suicidal debt trap for all Solomon Islanders and our future generations to come.

Speaking on the motion in Parliament to approve State of Public Emergency and for its continuation in the next four months, Wale said government should ban all international flights into the country, except for cargo and samples for tests (until testing can be done in-country). He also suggested regular tests for air crew who will be in isolation whilst in country and baggage handlers at Henderson. Wale said there should be appropriate isolation/quarantine for incoming international shipping freighters. “Economy needs to keep functioning to provide jobs and incomes for families. However, the PM’s hope that donor funded projects be brought forward may not be feasible, as it would involve mobility of labour,” he said. “Further, it is important to note that the spread of the coronavirus from China to other countries followed Chinese workers returning to those countries to work. “We must learn from that experience,” he said. Wale said the Pacific games construction project may be affected by this, if it will require Chinese workers. He said Government must not take the risk of importing covid-19 through foreign workers. “Our national security and public health safety cannot be compromised even for the Pacific games. Some pre-emptive planning must now commence to consider postponement of the games,” he said. Further to that, Wale said public service needs to keep operating to provide support services to the private sector to keep the economy functioning. He said the Public Service Memo dated 31st March 2020 should be withdrawn. 1. Ban on flights may only be lifted once source/destination cities/countries have demonstrated sustained reductions in the number of coronavirus infections. 2. In such an event, all travellers into the country must: a) obtain medical report confirming lack of covid-19 infection within 4 days prior to travel, and b) be quarantined on arrival for 14 days. 3. All Solomon Islands citizens abroad, including students, wishing to return must comply with 4 above. SIG to pay for tests for its sponsored students. 4. Quarantine facilities must be fit for purpose to not become fertile ground for the spreading of the coronavirus. Wale said conversely, the government could enter into dialogue with Australia to beg that Solomon Islands students be quarantined in their detention facilities on Christmas Island. He said this would work for our students in Philippines, if a decision was taken to evacuate them. Wale said all citizens with no jobs or business interests in Honiara to be urged to leave for their villages. “Ideally, all these should be tested for covid-19 to ensure the virus is not unwittingly spread to the provinces. “Close and police the border with Bougainville. “Set up lab to conduct all tests in-country,” he said.

The meeting, called by the Premier of Malaita Province, was an attempt to bring the 14 Malaita Members of Parliament to discuss issues around the government’s switch diplomatic ties to China over Taiwan. Only five Malaita MPs in the opposition group attended the meeting. Malaita MPs in the government were blocked by the government. The five opposition MPs’ response to the invitation to attend the meeting cost their constituencies. This is when the government blocked the five Malaita constituencies whose MPs attended the meeting from receiving the China-funded component of the Constituency Development Fund. Wale told parliament on Tuesday that the position by the Malaita provincial government against the switch to China is the Malaita provincial government’s opposition. He said the position of the Malaita provincial government is based on the fact that no political party sought a mandate to switch to China during national general elections. Wale said the decision by the Malaita provincial government was based on the Prime Minister’s promise to consult all constituencies and leave no stone unturned prior to making a decision which did not eventuated. He said the Malaita provincial government and most in the province does not accept being told after the decision to switch to China was made. Wale said the provincial government and its people were hoping to be consulted prior to making the decision but that did not happen. “These issues have caused them to feel disempowered, disenfranchised and deceived,” the MP for Aoke-Langalanga said. He said this is a reasonable position. Wale revealed during the meeting in Auki they informed the Malaita full provincial assembly that the meeting must not issue a communiqué as all 14 Malaita MPs need to listen to the issues raised. He said no communiqué was issued during their meeting. Wale said the communiqué that came out after their meeting belongs to the provincial government. He revealed the situation in Auki was tense and during a public meeting many people expressed their desired for the government to reverse its decision to switch to China. Wale noted there was strong sentiment expressed to have the Prime Minister resigned if the government failed to reverse its decision. He denied rallying the public in Auki to travel to Honiara and demanded the resignation of the Prime Minister. Wale said this is far from the truth. ‘In fact, I told the meeting they have the constitutional right to peaceful protest as violence has no place in political process and that violence will not achieve anything. Peaceful protest is good and nothing the government should be worried about,” Wale said. He said allowing peaceful protest is good for the country to allow citizens expressing their desire. Wale said once peaceful protests are continued to be denied, the grievances of the public will piled up and once overflow leads to violence. He said Malaita’s desire for independence is a “direct reaction” to the ongoing “deceptive decision making process” of the government. Wale said Malaitans are fade-up of being fooled. He said this is a sentiment many Malaitans expressed which holds some truth in it. Wale said his group is merely carrying out its duty as watchdog of the government’s decisions, indecisions, actions and lack of actions. He said there is nothing personal in the criticisms his group have raised. Wale stated the government recognize and respect constructive criticisms.",,,,,,,,,94,1.02

By Taromane Martin Is the government and stake holders going to ask for the 2023 Pacific Games in Honiara to be cancelled? That is the question hanging over Solomon Islands preparations to host the games in 2023. With the coronavirus pandemic making things even more difficult for facilities constructions or athletes’ preparations to start due to the worldwide travel restrictions, critics are saying it is not worth it now and the government should not continue to pursue this especially with the country’s economy struggling to stay afloat. The government through the Sol2023 National Hosting Authority is set to review the stadiums and facilities progress in October according to Solomon Islands Pacific Games Association Chairman Martin Rara. Mr Rara said once the review with all stake holders involved in the 2023 Pacific Games preparations is done then the Sol 2023 National Hosting Authority will make an announcement on the matter. “At this time the thing we should look at before we make any decision is work on the facilities are they progressing. “When work commences then we will be able to project or make an estimation as to when and if we will still be able to host the games in 2023. “However, I cannot say or tell you the date or any decision regarding postponing the date for the hosting of the games in Honiara. “Additional updates on the matter will be known after October when NHA will make a review on the progress of the constructions of the facilities. “At this time any decision to postpone the 2023 Pacific Games will be deliberated and made by and only the Sol2023 National Hosting Authority board,” he said. SunSPORTS recently had contacted NHA for response whether the option of pulling out from hosting the games is now on the table especially with the COVID-19 pandemic causing a setback for the constructions of facilities. So far no response is yet to be received. However, NHA Chief Executive Officer, Christian Nieng had confirmed work is progressing on site and that facilities constructions will start after the UXO exercise on clearing the sites is completed by the end of this month. “The UXO work is on-going. Final reports expected by end of the month to prepare for PRC design work to start. “The Geo-Tech work has already started however these sites need to be cleared from UXO first before they do the Geo-Tech can resume,” Nieng said. The Pacific Games Council (PGC) last month had been forced to postpone next year’s Mini Pacific Games in the Northern Marianas to 2022 due to the pandemic. Despite the cancellation of the 2021 Mini games, PGC Chief Executive Officer Andrew Minogue had told SunSPORTS that they are going to continue to monitor and keeping a close eye on the situation. “The Pacific Games Council is pleased to note the progress Solomon Islands Government and the National Hosting Authority are continuing to make in securing the necessary donor arrangements to deliver the venues on time for the 2023 Pacific Games. “The PGC continues to monitor the situation closely watching developments in the making,” Mr Minogue had said. Meanwhile lead advisor to the National Hosting Authority, Clint Flood also admitted that they had not expected Covid-19 to impact the construction timeline at this stage. He said while the feeling in Solomon Islands remained positive, officials were preparing themselves for all possibilities and should have a better idea of the overall picture in a couple of months’ time. Flood, who himself was working remotely from his home in Canada, said even though Covid-19 had put a stop on international travel, work was continuing in China and the National Hosting Authority was in constant contact with its donor partners. Flood said all of the Pacific Games facilities were scheduled to be completed by the end of 2022 but with the competition not taking place until July 2023, there was some room to move. Provided all venues were ready to handover by the end of March 2023, Clint Flood said Solomon Islands' first ever Pacific Games would be good to go.",,,,,,,,,93,1.01

Mr Fa’abasua received his letter from Ministry of Provincial Government and Institutional Strengthening permanent secretary, Stanley Pirione on Sunday 9pm, informing him to stop work and immediately return to Honiara due to workloads in the ministry. Provincial Police Commander, Stanley Riolo confirmed the protest and his officers being on the ground to monitor it. Mr Riolo said the situation can turn worse if the government does not respond to protesters’ demand to allow Fa’abasua to continue his job in Auki. But MPGIS PS Pirione said it is a normal thing to recall provincial secretaries back to the headquarters because they work under the ministry. He said PS Fa’abasua was recalled due to pressing issues facing Malaita province so they can re-strategise ways to provide service deliveries. However, Pirione said due to the issue that came out lately, the Public Service Commission and the ministry will consult with Malaita province to sort out the issue. Malaita Premier Daniel Suidani said his MARA Government is saddened by the action of the Sogavare Government to remove its PS. Premier Suidani said the reason for recalling Fa’abasua does not make sense because the province has a lot of workload since the absence of Deputy Provincial Secretary and Treasurer. “I see this as direct action against my MARA Government by a government that is so indebt to China,” Suidani said to those who staged the protest yesterday. “Make no mistake my people, the Sogavare led government do not want Malaita to progress. This action as you rightly stated is a clear message to us that the Sogavare government only interests in making us worst off. “I can see that what you have demonstrated today is clear reaction to the Sogavare Government that is no longer have interest in the affairs of this country but only his political power. “With the arrival of the PRC ambassador it is clear Sogavare have to take actions to please the PRC. There is no question about that,” he said. “But let me assure you my good people that the MARA government will stand with you in demanding for an explanation from the national government of its action. “As you know the MARA government through its Executive has made a resolution not long ago to not allow our PS to be moved from the Province. Clearly the Government is not listening to that resolution,” he said. “I will quickly call an urgent meeting of my executive to look into this issue and make appropriate statements soon. “My good people of Malaita today we are in trying times and we must not lose hope. I can assure you that we will be set free from any decisions that go against us. “Let me assure you also that as long as the MARA government is leading the province we shall not stop fighting any injustices against the government and the people of Malaita Province. “Let us united and stand for our rights. Let us continue to be responsible for our place and for our people,” he said.",,,,,,,,,89,-1.03

A spokesperson from the Solomon Islands National Council of Women on behalf of the CSO leaders attending the meeting, said that they have noted the action by the Minister in his official capacity as serious, violating the Public Finance Act of Solomon Islands. CSO Leaders also feel that his action is a breach of his Oath of Allegiance as Minister of the Crown, not being loyal to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, and in performing his duties of not protecting and serving the interest of Solomon Islands Citizens and the nation. CSO leaders request the Minister to apologise to the nation on behalf of the DCGA Government because of the intended cause of action he took with the Broker by the name of Mr Terry Wong, to deal with few businessmen in China for the purpose of lending to the Solomon Islands Government USD100 billion. “This is a total breach of his Oath and Allegiance and therefore, should do the right thing by apologising to the nation,” they say. Solomon Islands as a sovereign nation must follow protocols in dealing with such serious loan matters on government to government basis and not using middle men with a predetermined 11 percent heavy interest fee, which will benefit only a few cronies to become billionaires overnight if the loan proposal is to be materialised. The Solomon Islands Government does not have the capacity to mortgage such a huge loan, and therefore will commit all Solomon Islands individual citizen, tribal land with its minerals and sea resources thus setting a new suicidal debt trap for all Solomon Islanders and our future generations to come. The CSO group also call on the Governor General of Solomon Islands to summon the Minister because of his negligence and respect of the Oath he took prior to taking up his position as Finance Minister. It would be for the interest of the nation for the Governor General to advise the Finance Minister on behalf of all Solomon Islands Citizens for the Minister to apologise or even better resign accordingly. CSOs also want to know whether the DCGA will continue to formalise consultations on the loan through the so called Mr Wong, or now have formally withdrawn its intention to pursue further negotiations on the matter. -SINCW PRESS",,,,,,,,,88,-1.05

The Solomon Islands and PRC signed a Framework Agreement Establishing Diplomatic Relations between the two countries only 6 months ago and according to a statement by Sogavare last week, he was inspired that this relationship has not only developed, but made invaluable progress despite the limitations caused by the COVID-19 Pandemic.

The Island Sun News,theIslandSunNews,1.00064E+14,MEDIA_NEWS_COMPANY,SB,Island Sun is the leading daily newspaper in the Solomon Islands. This is our official Facebook page.,43117.00903,23794,24559,2021-05-20 22:44:36 EDT,44336,0.947638889,Photo,83,47,19,4,2,5,6,0,0,0,,-,0,0,0,N/A,https://www.facebook.com/1887971264866723/posts/2788120768185097,"EDITORIAL- Yes, we attended that zoom session ISLAND Sun wishes to respond to a report the Adviser to Malaita Provincial Government, Celsius Talifilu, produced and circulated on social media this week. Firstly, we can confirm that our representatives attended a zoom session the Embassy of the People’s Republic of China (PRC) in Solomon Islands organized on 8 April 2021. We attended in good faith because we were invited. In fact, we always attend to invitations from the diplomatic missions in Honiara. For instance, just recently we attended an invitation the New Zealand High Commission sent us for evening drinks. So, there’s nothing sinister about our acceptance to attend the PRC Embassy’s invitation to the zoom session with media groups from Quandong Province. Secondly, we can confirm that during the zoom session we made a five-minute presentation about who we are. Again, the presentation was made on request from the PRC Embassy. In fact, all local media houses that attended made five-minute presentations about themselves during the session. The media houses from Quandong Province did the same. Thirdly, we can also confirm that Nanfang Media Group from Quandong sent us a letter after the zoom session enquiring about possible collaboration and partnership. We are currently looking into this request. One thing we can say is media houses in China have a lot to offer in terms of technical assistance, as well as other areas of media development. Fourthly, we can also confirm that the PRC Embassy has offered to assist us with our office equipment needs. The past year has not been easy for us financially. With significant drop in revenue due to COVID-19, we are barely struggling to survive above the waters. So, when this offer of assistance to meet our office needs came, we accepted it in good faith and with open arms. We wish to state that there were no conditions or strings attached to this assistance. It was a genuine assistance from a development partner to an organization that is struggling in the face of the pandemic. We’ve received similar assistance in the past from the Australian Government immediately after the ethnic tension. This was channelled through a media strengthening programme called SOLMAS, set up to assist the local media get back to its feet after the tensions. In fact, all media houses benefitted from the SOLMAS assistance. Fifthly, and finally, we wish to assure our readers that our independence as a private news organization remains intact. We have a very vibrant and dynamic newsroom managed by an experienced Editor, who is not giving away the independence of our news coverage to any external forces, just yet. We continue to pursue stories of national interests within all sectors of the country, and we’ll remain at the forefront of independent journalism in our beloved country.",https://www.facebook.com/theIslandSunNews/photos/a.1969037396760109/2788120711518436/?type=3,,,,,,,,83,-1.98

A government minister involved in the discussions confirmed to the Island Sun that William Soaki in Suva, Fiji, will be shifted to replace High Commissioner Barnabas Anga in Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea. Anga is likely to be recalled to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and External Trade headquarters in Honiara. Former Ambassador to Brussels, Belgium, Joseph Ma’ahanua is likely to replace Robert Sisilo in Canberra, Australia. Ma’ahanua is currently serving at headquarters in Honiara. Sisilo will be transferred to Suva to replace Soaki. Furthermore, Barett Salato is transferring to Auckland, New Zealand, after the closure of Solomon Islands Mission in Geneva, Switzerland, in June 2020 due to financial constraints. The Geneva mission opened in 2011 and with its closure, the Solomon Islands mission in neighbouring Brussels will take over all the functions performed by the mission. Meanwhile, Dr Transform Aqorau, who was appointed last year to head the country’s mission in New York, United States of America, is yet to take up his post. Sources said Government is yet to finalise the terms of service regarding Aqorau’s engagement. Aqorau is the country’s foremost expert in international maritime law. He had previously served with the Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency in Honiara, Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat in Suva and founding CEO of the Majuro-based Parties to the Nauru Agreement (PNA). He’s currently here at home awaiting his travel. A cabinet insider said agreements from host Governments and appointments of Public Service Commission and Governor General and Prime Minister are next to happen.

The Committee will spend today and tomorrow excavating issues relating to the report. According to the hearing schedule produced by the National Parliament yesterday, former and current HCC treasurers, Honiara City Clerk and Mayor will stand before the office of the Auditor General, Permanent Secretary of Home Affairs, Permanent Secretary of Finance and Director Debt Management Unit within the Ministry of Finance. The hearing will be interesting as no one has been accounted for the allegations found in the Honiara City Council Audit Report last year. HCC councillors and certain officials have been at loggerhead since last year when the former chairman of finance Billy Abae made a call to investigate the unaccounted revenue collected for the sale of fire extinguishers, under what was found to be a Public Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement between the Council and a Chinese firm for buying of fire extinguishers. On November 15 last year a PPP Agreement was signed with Jingsan Anbao Firefighting Company Ltd of China on trial basis – an agreement Abae questioned HCC about and was sacked from his position as a result. Another Councillor, Regional Ngati was also kicked out from his portfolio on reasons that he was among the network of councillors who tried to destabilise HCC Administration under City Mayor Wilson Mamae’s leadership. Earlier this year, the office of the Auditor General began conducting what it calls a ‘Spot on Audit’ at the directive of the Minister of Home Affairs Chris Laore following allegations of widespread financial mismanagement and illegal borrowings. “Most of our officers are doing the reporting while assessing the books. “We are expecting to complete the auditing by end of this month. But this is subject to reporting if we are not satisfied, then might extend the deadline,” Auditor General Peter Lokay told Island Sun.",https://www.facebook.com/theIslandSunNews/photos/a.1969037396760109/2732483413748833/?type=3,,,,,,,,81,-2.02

Prime Minister Sogavare said, internally, the consequences of last November riots is around $800 million. 1000 jobs were lost and many more livelihood of our people affected. He stated, “from last November’s riots, it is obvious, current security agreement with Australia is inadequate to deal with our hard internal threats. The economic impact of the November Riots has nearly crippled Solomon Islands.” Prime Minister Sogavare explained, the tendency to frequently having to deal with riots leave the government no option but to enter into security agreement with other bilateral partners to plug the gaps that exists in our security agreement with Australia. He strongly maintains, the new SI-China treaty does not provide for a naval and/or military base. The Prime Minister further added, Solomon Islands is also working on security agreements with Papua New Guinea and Fiji to address our soft and hard security threats. *GCU PR",https://www.facebook.com/sundayisles/photos/a.725125640899367/5046239218787966/?type=3,,,,,,,,80,1.45

Opposition Leader Mathew Wale’s ongoing rants against the Prime Minister over the Security Cooperation with China claiming it as a personal “deal” and that the Prime Minister is exercising autocratic leadership are classic examples of a “leader” that has nothing good in place for people but mere hatred to create disunity in the country. Sogavare said while the Government continues to enlighten people about representative democracy and how the country is governed, some leaders such as Mathew Wale and East Are’ Are MP, Peter Kenilorea Junior (PKJ) chose to employ misinformation as their strategy to discredit the Government. “I find it really distasteful that these people have not been truthful, instead they have been feeding misinformation to our people,” Sogavare said. “It is indeed a shameful act by the Leader of the Official Opposition to continue to mislead the people of Solomon Islands in his so-called Press Statements and interviews,” the Prime Minister added. In recent weeks, a lot has been said on the decision by a democratically elected Government, empowered by the Constitution of Solomon Islands to enter into security arrangements with partners of choice. Quite interestingly, only the security arrangement between the People’s Republic of China and Solomon Islands is of concern to certain persons. Sogavare repeated that the Security Agreement is not a private arrangement. It is a bilateral treaty between two sovereign states, Solomon Islands and the People’s Republic of China (PRC). “The Leader of Opposition knows this very well but he chose to say otherwise to our people, deliberating lying to them. He then goes on to say that this security treaty is targeting Malaita, and in saying this he is indirectly saying to the people that I continue to be anti-Malaita. This is not the first time that the Leader of Opposition has made such ludicrous accusations,” Sogavare said. Sogavare further pointed out Solomon Islands also have a security arrangement with Australia that was signed in 2017 without consultation and it was also not a private agreement but agreement between Solomon Islands and Australia. “Let me make it clear to our people that both of these agreements with Australia and China were endorsed by Cabinet and executed in accordance with our national security objectives to maintain internal peace and stability in contrary to the misinformation trumpeted by the Leader of Opposition,” Sogavare said. “The Leader of Opposition is fully aware of the principles of representative democracy. Yet he has time and time again, continued to mislead the people as to its meaning,” he added. Sogavare said the Leader of Opposition knows that the processes that the Government has employed and continues to employ complies with the system of representative democracy, yet he fails to make that acknowledgement because he refuses to accept that it is this representative democracy that places him as the leader of Opposition.

This was despite public perception, mostly labelling the ESP as a failed project of the government because of the lack of stimulation of the economy. The two main policy objectives of the ESP were: 1. to prevent the economy from deterioration following the outbreak of the COVID-19 in China in December 2019, and 2. Promote aggregate demand in the economy. Permanent Secretary of Ministry of Finance and Treasury, Mckinni Dentana told reporters on Tuesday that when they did the model in 2020, they estimated negative growth of 4.5 percent on the economy. However, he said at the end of 2020 when they ran the model, it shows the deterioration of economy is not severe as expected in their initial assessment. “We come up to negative growth but at 3.5 percent compared to more than 4.5 percent,” Dentana said “We have achieved the objective of the policy to prevent the economy from further deteriorating,” he added. Furthermore, PS Dentana said to promote aggregate demand was to ensure domestic activity happened in the economy despite covid 19. He said this included supply of copra, cocoa and timber and other commodities must continue to reach markets during the year and throughout 2021. “There are some data we received at the end of 2020. “For example, copra productions have increased to 37,000 metric tones higher than in 2019,” he said. Dentana said in 2019 they recorded around 8,000 metric tonnes of copra. He said in 2020, they have around 12,000 metric tones which the country has exported. “That is one indication that there was continuation of trading activity despite the covid,” he said. Dentana said the Government has provided subsidies to transports and support farmers so they could harvest their products and bring them to the markets. He said cocoa experienced a mix result because Government supported farmers around July to September. However, Dentana said the peak season for cocoa was around the first quarter of the year. He said despite covid, around 4,000 metric tonnes of cocoa were exported. On timbers, Dentana said the reaction of timber in the market happened in 2021 because most of the activities and supports were offloaded to exporters. “For example, in 2019, around 542,000 cubic meters of timbers have been exported. “In 2020, around 500,000 metric tones, and in 2021 it increased to 763,000 metric tonnes,” he said. Further to that, Dentana said around 13,000 tonnes of kava have been exported. As such, he said the Government has achieved its second policy intention. In terms of recovery, Dentana said Government has assisted State Owned Enterprises, private companies and made commitment to big infrastructure projects. He said the Tauba and Kwai bridges on Malaita province are fully operational now. He said it is unfortunate for the Fiu bridge, it did not eventuate eventhough Government has committed $30 million to the World Bank. Dentana said Government also supported Raoe bridge in East Malaita and the ramp in Kirakira. He said upgrading of Sege and Taro airports are coming up this year. Further to that, Dentana said Government also supported Solomon Airlines, Solomon Water and Development Bank of Solomon Islands.",https://www.facebook.com/theIslandSunNews/photos/a.1969037396760109/2999760933687745/?type=3,,SYSTEM LMA EDA IST -19 × IUMI TUGE AGAINS COVID-,,,,,,78,-2.1

The U.S. delegation alleged that there are potential regional security implications of the agreement, including for the United States and its allies and partners.

In accordance with the principles of on equal footing, mutual respect and non-interference into each other's internal affairs, the cooperation in security and other fields between China and Solomon Islands conforms to international law and norms and is conducive to regional stability and development. Both China and Solomon Islands have repeatedly emphasized that reports on so-called Chinese military base in Solomon Islands are misinformation fabricated by those people with ulterior motives. Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Solomon Islands, the exchanges and cooperation between two countries in various fields have yielded fruitful results and been warmly welcomed by two peoples.

In her speech to mark the international day of women, the prime minister’s wife said women’s rights must be meaningfully acknowledged and appropriately placed in the decision-making process of our global societies. “I must congratulate all women, in all works of life to continue to fight against discrimination and marginalization of women and vulnerable groups in the world. “As a least developing country, Solomon Islands can relate to the realities of the issues raised by women every year, on gender-based violence, for example SI is ranked amongst countries with very high rates of violence against women, the reports are sickening to read.” She said the rising reported cases of sexual abuse committed by people in positions of trust in the homes is unbelievable, especially in a country that professes Christianity as its religion; that being the case, no amount of cultural and traditional reasons can justify such actions. “We must continue to fight against these abuses. “I must also acknowledge that women’s rights are one only of the many issues that we are grappling with in this country, we can raise the same kind of sentiments in many other issues that affect the lives of our people,” Sogavare said. She said while one cannot rule out the reality of the fixed attitude by leaders and people in responsible positions, which interestingly include women, like in many countries including Solomon Islands, one must appreciate the structural, cultural and other realities that influence the way the system thinks. which women must continue to bring to the attention of leaders. Chinese Ambassador Li Ming reinforces this message by saying women are creators of human civilization and drivers of social progress, and they have made extraordinary achievements across all fields of endeavour. “My Embassy staff often go shopping at Honiara Central Market, and we see women running business there. Some of them bring their kids. They work so hard, but always look happy and resilient. I think like women in China, they are fighting for the family, for their children, and for a better life. We should pay high respect to women, including to those medical workers, public service, policewomen who are at the front line of fighting the pandemic of COVID-19,” Mr Li said.",https://www.facebook.com/theIslandSunNews/photos/a.1969037396760109/2738597029804138/?type=3,,,,,,,,77,-2.13

Worship Light. This comes after the vessel violated international and domestic maritime regulations. MV. Worship Light left Zhangjiagang, China on the first of April 1st 2020, and arrived in the country on the 15th of April, 2020. On 15 April 2020, the MV WORSHIP LIGHT entered the port of Honiara in Solomon Islands and anchored in the harbour area with no authorisation of the Solomon Islands Port Authority and failed to provide pre-arrival information despite request of the Port Authority and in accordance to the Maritime Safety Administration (Ship and Port Security) Regulations 2011. The following security regulations as per the International Ships and Port Facility security code (ISPS) and PFSP have been violated. • Section 5.8.1 (PFSP) “The Port Pilot controls the movement of vessels entering or leaving the port. • International Ships and Port Facility security code (ISPS) regulated that ships must report their intentions to enter a port 72 hours before arrival. • Any regulated ship that intends to visit the port, must be notified for clearance before entering the port. • Section 5.9.1 (PFSP), International ships intending to enter Honiara Port must notify the PFSO 72 hours prior to arrival. Ship profile must be screened by the PFSO to ensure the ship is complaint to ISPS Standards and that is safe for pilot to board. With the current state of emergency imposed in the country and the global Covid 19 pandemic, Solomon Ports view the ship’s behavior as suspicious and a threat to the country’s security. SIMSA has also requested the ship to leave the Solomon Islands waters immodestly. Solomon Ports strongly urge local shipping agents to ensure ships entering the country’s waters must abide by our maritime laws.

About $4.1 million was given by Republic of China (ROC) Taiwan for this project under the 2019 Supplementary Appropriation Bill 2020. Clerk to Parliament David Kusilifu told the Public Accounts Committee on Monday that the money was used for consultancy fee and upgrade on the sound system. He said Parliament had completed $173,639.77(AUD$29,000) payment for Information Communication Technology equipment already. The sound system was set up in Parliament in 2009. RAMSI through its Machinery of Government Program committed more than $1.25 million towards the installation of the new chamber system. Kusilifu said the challenge now is to get the technicians from Australia to upgrade the equipment. He said there would be upgrade on audio visual where instead of people standing in Parliament with camera, there will be automated camera from the media booth.

This sentiment was echoed by John Kina, a long-time resident of Honiara. Kina told the Solomon Star Sore’s reluctance to reveal the identity of the private entity that supplied the fire extinguishers to the council and his subsequent admission to the transaction which was alleged to be unbudgeted for amounts to gross negligence of due processes. “To me, the issue of the fire extinguishers has already warranted criminal investigation because it has not been budgeted for in the first place,” he said. He said Sore’s refusal to reveal the private entity whilst at the same time admitting to local transactions, is an indication that something fishy is going on at the highest level of the council. Kina said that since Szetu has denied being part of the deal, he needs to prove his innocence that the property in which the fire extinguishers are stored upon arrival from china is someone else’s. An insider within the HCC has revealed that the unloading of the fire extinguishers was done at Szetu’s warehouse at his Outback Shop at Rove, next to Children’s Park.

The announcement by Deputy Prime Minister Manasseh Maelanga has nothing to do with the release of the covid-19 equipment, Police Commissioner Mostyn Mangau told reporters in a press conference yesterday. Mr Mangau implies that the premature announcement by DPM Maelanga undermines police investigations and processes, since they are not linked. “The announcement done by the Deputy Prime Minister in Malaita about the release of the medical equipment has nothing to do with police investigation or undermines the police investigation processes.” Mr Maelanga had announced to the provincial government and people of Malaita on Friday last week, during the celebration of the 37th Malaita Day, that the impounded covid-19 equipment would be released “soon”. Coincidentally, this statement was realised on Monday this week. Commissioner Mangau explains that police conducted investigation into the consignment after they received a formal complaint from the office of the Attorney General. Upon completion, and with police satisfied with their findings, Mangau said they forwarded their report to the Director Public Prosecutions (DPP) for viewing. Mangau adds, DPP then made their advice based on the findings, and police released the consignment back to Customs, which then made a proper release to the Malaita province. However, Mangau says investigation continues despite the consignment’s release; “investigation is still ongoing on areas of how the consignment has been channelled through”, says Mangau. The covid-19 equipment was confiscated on June 16 by government citing “suspicious nature surrounding the importation of the cargoes”. The cargo was the second batch of covid-19 equipment donated by Taiwan under its global counter-covid19 programme, which was offered to any country including those which do not have diplomatic relations with Taiwan. The consignment was sent for Malaita Province. Police said they had become suspicious at the cargo being addressed to a post office box belonging to a person who lived at Kaibia Settlement, Honiara, and the sender’s address being “not proper” and not addressed to the Malaita Provincial Government. Police in their recent explanation following public criticism on the seizure said the RSIPF Act 2013 gives police the powers to investigate any suspicious act by any citizen of Solomon Islands that might lead to the contravening of any laws of the country. This infamous move by government to impound the humanitarian aid has been widely criticised as a direct display of Beijing’s stooge oblivious of the welfare of the people of Malaita against the current covid-19 pandemic. Malaita declared following the seizure that it had sought assistance from our former ally, Republic of China (Taiwan), to help the province prepare itself for any possible covid-19 entry.",,,,,,,,,74,-1.24

When customs officers sought legal basis for this, none was given and the equipment was taken away by the Police,” the province said in a statement today. The equipment was donated on humanitarian grounds by Republic of China and shipped to a Malaitan person who was going to donate them to Malaita Province. The MARA Government called on the Commissioner of Police and Attorney General to explain what legal basis was used to hold up this life saving equipment. The equipment included one set of Thermal Image Camera plus monitor and 2 Thermal temperature cameras to check people for fevers on entry to Malaita, and was specifically donated to assist with fighting COVID 19. “This appears to be a direct action against the fight of COVID-19 in Malaita the most populated province of Solomon Islands. It is also an action that is contrary to the purpose for which a State of Public Emergency is declared,” a statement from Auki said this afternoon. “We would like to know: Why is lifesaving equipment for Malaita held up when it is to fight COVID-19? We know that a whole range of limitations to Constitutional Rights and Freedoms have been put on the people of Solomon Islands in the name of COVID-19, including closing of borders. However, exemptions have been made for the arrival of supplies from PRC and others. “But when there is COVID-19 equipment donated to Malaita, the DCGA based on advice from the AG has ordered the Police to seize it. This looks like it is an action against the public health of Malaitans, and against the justifiable purpose of the State of Public Emergency,” the province said. The Malaita Provincial Government would like to see that the Commissioner of Police and the Attorney General quickly resolve this matter so as to ensure the equipment are freed.

Mr Suidani made the admission when he met with the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Provincial Government and Institutional Strengthening (MPGIS) in Honiara, Friday last week. He told PS Dick Stanley Pirione that he had no prior knowledge of the protest which was orchestrated by M4D without seeking permission from the Malaita Provincial Police Commander (PPC) in Auki. The national government is aware that the protest march was organised by M4D to reinstate Provincial Secretary Frederick Fa’abasua after he was recalled to Honiara by the Ministry of Provincial Government. Suidani further admitted that the M4D is not legally recognised by the Malaita Provincial Government to claim that they represent the majority of Malaita people. A week earlier, M4D wrote to the Auki Chinese Business Community to immediately shut down business and leave the province following disagreement with the arrival of the China-Honiara flight which brought in Solomon Islands nationals and China’s ambassador to the country, along with Chinese technical experts who will oversee work on infrastructure projects for the 2023 Pacific Games. M4D also issued a media statement claiming that they have signed an MOU with the Auki Chinese Community to monitor the movement of Chinese business people in and out of Auki for fear of bringing in covid-19 into the country. Premier Suidani admitted that the actions of M4D do not have the backing of the provincial government, a statement which was fully noted by national government officials attending the meeting. Suidani said Malaita province is thankful to the national government through the Ministry of Provincial Government and Institutional Strengthening for its ongoing assistance to Malaita province in spite of the ongoing political differences. PS Pirione also informed Premier Suidani and his delegation at the meeting that the request for PS Fa’abasua to remain at Auki will be discussed with relevant authorities. Meanwhile, Fa’abasua has been advised to remain in Auki awaiting further advice either from the MPGIS or the Ministry of Public Service. In the meantime, his recall still stands. --GOVERNMENT COMMUNICATION UNIT",,,,,,,,,73,-1.26

Commissioner of Forest Reeves Moveni confirmed this when asked by Chairman of Public Accounts Committee through a virtual meeting yesterday. The PAC was enquiring into the 2023 Appropriation Bill 2022 budget. Moveni said his office facilitated the export by Sunrise company, based on advice from Attorney General, Comptroller of Customs, Jim Sutton and Director of Environment, Joe Horokou. Ete also asked what the Government’s policy was on the ban of tubi. Moveni said under the regulation (Forest Resources and Timber Utilization (protected species) Regulations 2012), there was an amendment made where tubi can only be harvested on mining tenement areas only. He said any place outside of mining tenement is prohibited. Moveni said this goes in line with approved permits from Director of Environment before his Office can allow. “If no approval comes from the Director, there won’t be any harvesting,” he added. However, the landowners of Korona are challenging the government on this case and it is still pending for Judicial Review in the High Court. The landowners of Korona have described the export as ‘fraud’ and ‘broad daylight corruption’, allegedly backed by Attorney General Office, Solicitor General Savenaca Banuve, Director of Environment Joe Horokou, Commissioner of Forest Reeves Moveni, to allow Sunrise to export the logs on 6th November 2022. The landowners were convinced after they cited the Bill of lading that shows Sunrise Investments Ltd exported 5,000 cubic meters of tubi trees to the buyer, Karridale PTD, Ltd in China. Sunrise Investments Ltd got around $4.9 million, the Free on Board (FOB) value of the logs, through a Letter of Credit from Pan Oceanic Bank, on the export. The Bill of lading document also shows the shipping vessel, MV Victoria Voy loaded the tubi logs at Lelegia. Lelegia is another log pond, about six kilometers across the pristine Thousand Ships Bay on the mainland of Isabel. It has also kept huge stockpile of Tubi trees. Mas Solo Investment Ltd, another Malaysian logger, holds the lease over the area. The Korona landowners said the tubi issue is still pending for Judicial Review, while the Solicitor General, allegedly unlawfully ordered Director of Environment to issue export permit to Sunrise Investments Ltd. They claimed Sunrise Investments Ltd owner, Richard Song Sing Ngea did plead guilty last December to a criminal case the Solomon Islands Director of Public Prosecution (DPP) filed on instructions from the Ministry of Environment, accusing the company of illegally harvesting Tubi trees. Ngea was fined $50,000 (USD$6,232), the maximum penalty for such an offence. But the company’s license has not been cancelled so it can resume operations if it wishes. The Korona landowners are calling on appropriate authorities to intervene and investigate this matter in order to get ride off corrupt practice within the ministries and Attorney General office. “Who do we trust here?” one of the Korona landowners asked.",https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=533382028801530&set=a.467517165388017&type=3,,,,,,,,73,-2.52

These include Australia Government, World Health Organisation, United Nations Children Fund, New Zealand Government, World Bank, Asian Development Bank, People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the various philanthropists. Speaking at the handing over of the $1.38 million two pre-fabricated quarantine units handed by the Australia Government to the Ministry of Health and Medical Services at Henderson last Friday, Minister Mua said COVID-19 provides us with an opportunity for forward thinking and forward looking in terms of the health system of this country. “To better cope with COVID-19, we need to improve the health system by ensuring that our health system is better placed to deal with emerging public and curative health crisis now and in the future. “Friends, we all did not anticipate this virus to occur and therefore we did not have a planned budget for this emergency,” he said. “However, we have stepped up and worked around the existing capacity and the resources to prepare and to response in the event that we have a confirmed case,” he said. China donated about 125,400 pairs of disposal rubber gloves as part of PPE donations from China, QCPR machine for testing COVID-19 samples in Honiara and others. New Zealand provided an x-ray machine set up in the Isolation Ward in National Referral Hospital. Australia has also assisted the NRH with medical equipment, QCPR machine for testing, GeneXpert cartridges and also the National Disaster Council for the recent Cyclone Harold. WHO has supported procurement efforts and shipped over one million COVID-19 testing kits to 129 countries. More than 5.3 million tests are being procured within the Diagnostics Consortium over the next four weeks- for distribution to 135 low and middle income countries including Solomon Islands.

The warning came following a successful joint operation carried out in Honiara on Monday 25th January 2021 between BSI officers and the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force (RSIPF) officers on shops that breached the BSI Act 2013 with the importation and selling of planting seeds without BSI authorized import permit. Eight (8) Chinese owned shops from Point Cruz, Central Market, China Town and Kukum area were caught to have unlawfully smuggling and selling planting seeds without an import permit at the time of the operation. “All items found in the shops during the operation were confiscated and brought to BSI office for further verifications before destroying,” Samuel Hone of the BSI Compliance & Auditing said. “During our search and interview with shop owners it is evident that they have breach the Biosecurity Act 2013 because they do not possessed or displayed any permit to import plants and plant product into Solomon Islands. “Even planting seed packets are written with foreign languages that Solomon Islanders cannot read which are not recommended by the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) standard for selling to the public. No permit to import plants and plants product obtain from Biosecurity office, MAL. No proper label to identify plant botanical names, no numbering or coding of packets and accompanying list is provided to link their botanical names. “Labelling on the seed packets are different from what is actually inside the packets. “Seed packet labelling are not from the approved sources of Biosecurity Solomon Islands and there is no specific expiry date on the packets,” Mr. Hone explained. “The 8 shop owners have been advised to pay a non-compliance penalty fee of $5,000 each, failure to do so within 14 days means facing prosecution,” he added. BSI confirmed that five (5) shop owners have already turned up and paid their fines while the remaining 3 are retailers only. Francis Tsatsia Director of BSI thanked RSIPF for supporting his officers during the joint operation and looks forward to similar future collaborations. Mr.Tsatsia said the raid is very important and the support of the Police to ensure this is supported and implemented under the law is critical. “Biosecurity must ensure what is regulated under the Act in terms of goods imported and exported must be adhere to at all times. There is a procedure established under the Biosecurity Act on how to import seeds for planting in this particular case. Seed for planting is a regulated good which means it has some elements of risk associated with if imported without Biosecurity risk analysis processes. Other pests and diseases that are seed born can be transmitted through seed and can spread to Solomon Islands if Biosecurity process is not follow.” He added the risk is real and in most cases cannot be detected by eye sight. “Not all countries can supply seeds for planting to Solomon Islands. Only those that meet Solomon Islands import condition can supply seeds for planting into Solomon Islands. Biosecurity has a list of approved companies where seed can be imported from,” he said. He further said that it is important to note that anyone either companies and individual who are interested to import any seed for planting from overseas must consult Biosecurity office to get update information on how to import and to ensure your source or the supplier is approved under Biosecurity law. “It is a requirement by law that you must have an import permit issue by Biosecurity Solomon Islands first before you bring in seeds for planting into Solomon Islands. “There is a penalty by fine and imprisonment if companies or individuals found breaching any of this very important requirement.

Secretary to Prime Minister, Dr Jimmy Rodgers confirmed this when he appeared before the Public Accounts Committee in Parliament yesterday. PAC was enquiring into the $206,088,699 in the 2019 Supplementary Appropriation Bill 2020. This includes $12,005,369 under Contingency Warrants and $194,083,327 under Advance Warrants. About $10 million was injected by PRC into the NDC last year under the Advance Warrant. Chairman of PAC, Douglas Ete said the PM discretionary funds were paid to supporters of government and not the Opposition. Ete said this practice started since the Republic of China, Taiwan, funds. “I have not seen a policy on it,” Ete said. “I think even if it’s a discretion fund, it must come to Parliament for appropriation,” he said. SPM Rodgers said what has been in place is historical understanding how discretion fund was disbursed out. He said it’s useful for government and future government to have something so people don’t ask it. Rodgers said there is an arrangement that the discretion fund will stop in the third year and change to development funds for members of Parliament to use in constituencies. Former Prime Minister and MP for South Malaita, Rick Hou said it is good to see in the long run the discretion fund will be phased out and OPMC consider to channel through other channels. Hou said the NDF should be administered by relevant ministries because if it continues under the Prime Minister, it will be too political because PRC is interested in buying votes.",,,,,,,,,69,-1.33

Speaking at the launching, Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said the Government’s partnership with the private sector is of unparalleled importance and this Government will continue to work together with the Solomon Islands Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SICCI) to drive our country forward during these unprecedented times. Sogavare said this partnership with SICCI was forged back in 6th July 2017 when a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between him, the Minister of Commerce, Industry, Labour and Immigration and the Chairman of SICCI. “This partnership has provided a platform for policy discussions and for both parties to explore new ways and ideas of doing business across both sectors, and I must say what better time to explore new ways and ideas then now, during the “new normal”. “This partnership has also gave rise to some initiatives, which includes SICCI to be consulted in pre-budget meetings, provide inputs to infrastructure development, minimum wage discussions, and being involved in other areas of mutual interest, such as the undersea cable project,” he said. The Democratic Coalition Government for Advancement 100 days policy was also launched during the Prime Minister’s Breakfast, which was also an initiative of this partnership. During Sogavare’s first state visit to People’s Republic of China, he was also accompanied by members of SICCI as well.

According to concern, Solomon Islands is far from ready to tackle the virus spreading throughout the world, so measures must ensure that the coronavirus does not enter Solomon Islands. The recent issued activated measures taken by the Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS), in collaboration with other agencies, to counter the potential outbreak of the Coronavirus in the country is not good enough, point out citizens debating. “Measures must ensure that the virus does not enter the country. That means restrictions must start at the port of embarcation, not at our airport. If they show some symptoms of the virus, they must be deported out of the country before they bring the virus in. That also includes showing the certificate from a certified health facility to show that they have been checked for the virus. I don’t believe the country has the capacity to manage the crisis if the virus enters the country,” said a citizen discussing on social media. Another citizen discussing said there should be total shutdown from the ports and airports of the country and turn back people just like what neighbouring countries in the Pacific are currently doing. “Honiara residents must be on alert. The virus is reported to be in Fiji, much closer to home,” added another concerned citizen. From report, the coronavirus symptoms are thought to appear between two and 10 days after contracting the virus. There is also some evidence, as yet unconfirmed, that the virus can be spread by asymptomatic people (people who carry the virus but are not yet sick). “If this is correct it will make the virus considerably more difficult to control,” say report from The Telegraph. The coronavirus to be spread by asymptomatic people is what adds to public concern calling for total shutdown in banning flights. There are now eight confirmed cases of coronavirus in Australia while the death toll in China rises to 170 as reported on Thursday 30th.",,,,,,,,,69,-1.33

Friday last week, the Chinese Ambassador to Solomon Islands, His Excellency, Mr. Li Ming handed a cheque of USD150 over SBD1.2 million to the Minister of Foreign Affairs and External Trade, Hon. Jeremiah Manele. “On behalf of the government of the People’s Republic of China, I am honored to hand over 150 thousand US dollars COVID-19 response funding support to the government and people of Solomon Islands”, stated the Ambassador. He acknowledged the ongoing work of the government stating hard work of front-liners in the preservation of public health and safety is greatly admired and appreciated. “China has always stood together with Solomon Islands in the fight against COVID-19 and remains ready to continue to cooperate with the government to tackle the global pandemic”. Ambassador Li Ming added that China promote the concept of building a community with a shared future of mankind, and a community of common health for mankind. He explained that this is reflected in the prompt response by China to the request of Solomon Islands to support efforts against COVID-19. “In May this year, China hosted the virtual special meeting on COVID-19 with Pacific Island countries to coordinate policies and share experiences. China has provided 300 thousand USD dollars funding support to Solomon Islands, helped built the first nucleic testing laboratory and provided 4000 test kits, 200 thousand personal protective equipment to health institutions”, outlined Mr. Li Ming. He concluded stating that the support of USD150 thousand is part of the ongoing support towards the government of Solomon Islands to ensure that the entry of the virus into the country remains contained and eliminated within those managed facilities. In his response Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Manele expressed deep appreciation of the Solomon Islands government to the support provided by PRC. “Your Excellency, the commitment demonstrated by your government since the permanent friendship and existence of diplomatic ties between our two countries simply indicates that that you are indeed a genuine friend”. “The financial assistance will be utilized for the refurbishment and repurposing the current TB ward at the national referral hospital which will allocate 16 self-contained COVID-19 isolation rooms that will be used to manage critical COVID-19 patients. “Overall the support received so far from PRC will surely continue to significantly help the country in its efforts to be vigilant in combating and fighting against this common global threat, COVID-19. Thank you indeed Ambassador”.

The call also follows the recent signing of the Telecommunications MOU by Government and China. Hon.

Such allegations sends clear signals on the what type of operator Huawei is and is worrying,” says Hon. Wale. The Opposition Leader goes on to state that, “The actions for which Huawei has been implicated can easily happen to our country given our size and vulnerability. “Thus, Solomon Telekom, as a strategic asset for our own national security purposes must be protected. “It is therefore incumbent on the PM to take note of Huawei’s track record elsewhere, and to never lose sight of the need to protect Solomon Telekom, and not to fall prey to promises of huge investment returns,” says Hon.

On Thursday, August 27, 2020 cabinet during its meeting approved the repatriation flights to Guangzhou in China and to Manila in the Philippines. “The flight to Guangzhou will be tomorrow (today) Tuesday, September 1, 2020,” Sogavare said in his weekly covid-19 nation-wide address yesterday. “The first two flights to Manila are scheduled for the 15th and 18th September 2020 respectively, with the dates of the 3rd flight to be confirmed,” he added. Sogavare said the Cabinet has permitted that the flight to both countries will be subjected to confirmation from the Ministry of Health & Medical Services that all testing requirement prior to and upon arrival must be complied with and entry of all incoming passengers be approved. “All passengers regardless of their nationality or status must undergo strict testing and quarantine protocols prior to and upon arrival. “According to our testing protocols, all passengers must undergo compulsory tests before boarding the flight. Anyone who is tested positive will not board the flight. “The flight to Guangzhou will be undertaken for purposes of facilitating the travel of PRC officials, PG2023 technical team as well as Solomon Islands citizens,” he said. He said for Philippines repatriation flight, Cabinet has also agreed following recommendations by the Oversight Committee, that repatriating Solomon Islands students should be prioritised because the Solomon Islands Government is directly responsible for students’ safety and well-being. “Well-over 400 students will be repatriated and all passengers must undergo the compulsory pre-testing requirements. “Our Ministries of Education, Foreign Affairs and Health are coordinating the testing arrangements for our students with the assistance from the World Health Organisation,” said Sogavare. He said the Government has acknowledged that this challenging and unprecedented time requires Cabinet to make tough decisions for the betterment of our country. “Therefore, the decision to repatriate passengers from China and Philippines was taken after a thorough analysis of risks and benefits. “That said, my good people, I would like to make it clear that the same treatment is given to all our bilateral and multilateral partners who are needed in the country to advance our national projects and national interest. “China does not get preferential treatment, as people might like to think. “In fact, other flights to repatriate citizens currently stranded in New Zealand, Australia, United Kingdom, USA and other European countries, as well as to bring in key foreign personnel for our development partner missions to help finance major development projects in the country are also in the planning process. “The same arrangement will be done for engineers for Tina Hydro project, the International Airport and the Kukum Highway projects. “There are no exceptions to our pre-departure requirements as well as our post arrival quarantine and testing protocols,” Sogavare said.",,,,,,,,,67,-1.37

This reduction in numbers was due to visa issues. Initially, 123 students were proposed to board the flight from Manila via Indonesia to Honiara. However, about 27 students were refused boarding by the Philippines Immigration officers at the Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila. Chairman of the Taskforce dealing with SI students in Philippines, Noel Matea said internal miscommunication within Philippines Immigration “costs a good number of our students not to board”. Matea, who works in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and External Trade, said their headquarters did not inform their officials at the airport in time on students that were already cleared with visas. A statement from National Disaster Council (NDC) said that prior to boarding, all returning student have completed three sets of covid-19 tests which were sent to SIG-Oversight Steering Committee (OSC) covid-19 response and the Ministry of Health for approval. Philippines is “high risk” for covid-19 infections. The change in the flight schedules was needed to give ample time for our health officials and the taskforce established by the OSC to liaise with Philippines Red Cross to coordinate changes to the passenger list for the first flight. “Timing for the second and third flights will be confirmed by the Oversight Steering Committee in due course,” the NDC statement said. “The returning students will be accommodated at government managed Quarantine Stations (QS) at Guadalcanal Beach Resort and Chengs Building both located in East Honiara,” it added. This first Philippine repatriation flight was the 12th flight Solomon Airlines had undertaken. Of the previous 11 flights, six were from Brisbane, two from Vila and Nadi, one from Auckland, one from Guangzhou, China and one from Apia, Samoa. At the moment, only 36 persons are undergoing quarantine at the government-managed quarantine sites. However, the number increased last night as the result of the arrival of students in Philippines. Solomon Islands remains covid-19 free to date. However, there are 18 positive cases of SI students based in Philippines, who are expected to return home after they are cleared by health authorities.",,,,,,,,,65,-1.42

China will provide urgent Anti-COVID Assistance

The Chinese government and people share empathy with the government and people of Solomon Islands for recent surge of COVID-19 cases in Solomon Islands. After first daily announcement of newly confirmed cases by the Honorable Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare, the Chinese Embassy in Honiara discussed anti-Covid 19 aid supplies with officials of the OPMC, MHMS and MFAET. China stands firmly with Solomon Islands in its fight against the pandemic and in the past years and has provided hundreds of thousands of PPEs, helped build first PCR laboratory, established the first isolation ward at the National Referral Hospital, and shared China’s knowhow. At this difficult time, we are sympathetic with those affected people and their families. China will provide urgent assistance to the government and people of Solomon Islands to help contain the spread of virus. The first shipment of urgent assistance from China includes:  
－Humanitarian funding of USD $320,000 (SBD $2,560,000)
－50,000 doses of SinoPharm vaccines 
－51,200 packs of disposable syringe (with needle)
－20,000 rapid antigen test kits (FAT)
－PPEs and medical supplies
－50 units of 5*6 meter tent kits for field hospital’s makeshift buildings

The first shipment of urgent medical supplies will arrive next week by Chinese government cargo flight. The field hospital tent kits are to be shipped by sea shortly. And China stands ready to respond to further assistance requests of SI government. Let us join hands with full confidence, and work together for a shared future.",,,,64,-2.56

GOVERNMENT is concerned that the Leader of Opposition has gone overboard to scheme up a plan to stall the 2023 Pacific Games.

Government revealed that honourable Matthew Wale’s plan is detailed in a publication by THE STRATEGIST- an online website.

Government revealed that Wale has suggested to Australia to ‘review’ its aid support and specifically suggesting to Australia, United States and other aid donors to withhold support for the 2023 Pacific Games.

“The Leader of the Opposition went to the extent of suggesting to Australia and USA to influence other Pacific Countries not to participate in the 2023 Pacific Games,” the government stated.

Government is concerned that such a plan is designed to make Solomon Islanders to suffer. To achieve what? Just to turn the public against the Prime Minister so that he can be Prime Minister.

“This is a one-man crusade for power. Unfortunately, he has cunningly used our innocent people to execute this evil plan of his,” the government stated in a media release.

“Wale’s plan shows his lack of humility and empathy of the suffering our people have already suffered because of his planned November Riots. He does not care if people go to prison, all he cares about is removing the Prime Minister so that he can be Prime Minister”, the government statement pointed out.

Government further revealed that Wale’s selfish plans include asking Australia to prevent Solomon Islanders from traveling to Australia via Brisbane.

“Wale further claimed that ministers in the government are not happy with the security pact with Peoples’ Republic of China (PRC) and claimed that this will be the cause of the downfall of the government. Wale seem to forget that Cabinet endorsed this Security Agreement and it was not one that was entered into by the Prime Minister,” the government statement added.

“What is more alarming, Wale is using the ignorance of the majority of Solomon Islanders to claim that everyone is against the security pact with PRC. Wale knows too well that the majority of Solomon Islanders are based in the rural areas, these are men and women who are concerned more about their day- today living than the political rhetoric in Honiara which Wale is huffing and puffing away with,” the government pointed out.

Government has made it clear that the security pact is to, amongst other things, protect and safeguard peace loving Solomon Islanders and their properties. It is to prevent what has happened in Myanmar from happening here in Solomon Islands.

“The Chinese built infrastructures are ours. Last Friday the training facility for our people and athletes was officially handed over to the Government and people of Solomon Islands,” the government said.

Government also highlighted that Wale’s continuous claim of an early warning he sounded to Australia’s embassy in Honiara is highly questionable as someone in the know claimed that the Australian ambassador never recalled having an audience with the Leader of Opposition in 2021 or thereabout.

Government has made it publicly that Australia remains the partner of choice in development needs of the country, and that sentiment will never change as long as the government is in power.

Government already had a fruitful meeting with a USA high level delegation and the meeting sets the basis for another meeting in September. On Monday the Government also had a meeting with a high level delegation who flew in from Tokyo.

“We have escalated our engagement with our bilateral partners and they have responded, all with the aim of developing our beloved country. Sadly, Wale is only interested in being the Prime Minister and not development,” the government stated added.

Wale’s hunger for power, is an open book. One has to go back to the election of the Prime Minister to the last motion of no- confidence to get to know the end-game that Wale has been aspiring for.

“Since his time as a Member of Parliament honourable Matthew Wale has been a minister only once and that was more than 10 years ago. His ambition to become Prime Minister has blinded him and he will go to the ends of the earth to achieve it, by using our unsuspecting people to do his dirty work,” the government concluded.

It has joined 179 countries that have diplomatic relations with the People’s Republic of China.

In a media statement yesterday, MHMS said the equipment are working and have been used in previous testing exercise of repatriates. “The Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS) would like to correct statements recently made in the media that a COVID-19 testing machine donated by one of our partners is not yet operational due to calibration, technical and language issues. In the month of May and April, MHMS received two COVID-19 testing machines called the qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) machines, each donated by People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the Australian Government. Both machines have been pre-calibrated by their manufacturing companies prior to sending them over to Solomon Islands and have passed quality control checks at the National Referral Hospital (NRH) Molecular Lab. Following the testing carried out at the NRH Molecular lab; both machines have satisfied internal and external quality controls provided by Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory (VIDRL) in Australia. Selected samples sent to VIDRL for validation and quality assurance confirms the quality assurance standards requirement. As such, both machines have fulfilled quality assurance requirements. Repatriates during May were tested using both machines as part of the quarantine protocol including suspected cases, with most of the tests performed using the China donated qPCR machine since the machine has 3000 test kits available to be used with. Both machines however require another type of kit called extraction kit to perform their tasks. Extraction kits procured from Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) which should have also accompanied the (BGI) qPCR donated by the PRC embassy could not be found as such an alternative extraction kit that was available called “pure link” was used instead with the China donated qPCR. Quality checks conducted showed acceptable results. While MHMS is working closely with the relevant partner to locate the missing extraction kits, it had recently procured 1000 extraction kits that arrived on 26th of June 2020. Additional 300 kits have also been donated by the Government of New Zealand, which arrived on 29 June 2020. MHMS will continue to ensure that both qPCR machines have the necessary accessories to continue conducting COVID-19 tests. The release of all 178 May repatriates in just two weeks is enough evidence of both machines as operational. If the machines have technical, calibration and language issues, the molecular laboratory at NRH would not be able conduct any COVID-19 test. In the Pacific only Fiji, New Caledonia, Guam and recently Solomon Islands perform COVID-19 tests with qPCR machine. WHO rates qPCR machines as one of the most sensitive and accurate methods for detecting, tracking and studying COVID-19. These machines have been the primary method for confirming COVID-19 cases globally. On this note, MHMS would like to assure everyone not to panic nor worry, as all the passengers scheduled to arrive this week will undergo COVID-19 testing both for any suspects and to fulfill the quarantine protocols before released to reunite with their families. MHMS continues to remain grateful to its donors and partners for their assistance in the country’s efforts to remain COVID-19 free and more especially for the capabilities to detect presence of COVID-19 and capacity building to contain and control possible entry and outbreak of COVID-19 in the country. Solomon Islands continue to be among the only 12 countries in the world to date that maintains a COVID-19 free status and in order for us to keep it that way, it requires solidarity, unity and combined efforts from everyone. This is the only and the most effective way forward to come out of this pandemic triumphantly. --MHMS PRESS",,,,,,,,,58,-1.59

Manele said it was not true that Solomon Islands will become a Communist State or the churches will be purged. He said Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Vanuatu and other countries in the Pacific region that have diplomatic relations with China have not become a Communist states. “Rather with the help of China they are well ahead of Solomon Islands in terms of infrastructure developments,” he said. Manele said China the second largest economy in the world and is Solomon Islands biggest trading partner. He said despite the economic challenges it face, as alluded to by the MP for Small Malaita Rick Hou, China has responded to their needs and supported their Rural Constituencies Development Funds (RCDF) for this year to 2022. Manele said discussions are underway in looking at game changing projects in the country. He said the development needs of this country is great, they need more friends. “More partners who can lift our people up and place them on a middle income pathway. “There are no country, no country in the world that does not need friends. We live in an interconnected world,” he said. Manele said a world connected by trade and challenged by global issues that knows no boundary. He said in this regards, they need China to be part of the global solution. Further to that, Manele said their relations with China has opened new opportunities, they became the 179th country to recognise PRC. He said opportunities exist for provincial, national, regional and international cooperation. “From education to health, from sports to infrastructure development. “Large scale investment from China has begun the Gold Ridge project. We hope to see more investments to cushion the declining forestry revenue,” he said. Manele said this week they have two delegations from China visiting the country. He said the delegation will be looking at further enhancing people to people cooperation.

The Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS) makes this statement after being alerted to a report of suspected ‘2019 novel coronavirus’ persons on a shipping vessel currently quarantined outside Rennell Island, on which they have responded to by sending a medical team. According to MHMS in a Media Statement, the medical team (sent yesterday) will provide the clinical assessment and also to take samples for laboratory confirmation. “MHMS has been alerted to a report of suspected 2019 novel coronavirus persons who displayed flu-like symptoms on a shipping vessel and is responding to the situation by sending a medical team to the shipping vessel that is currently quarantined outside Rennell Island,” said MHMS issued. “This team will provide the clinical assessment and also to take samples for laboratory confirmation. “The MHMS is working in collaboration with other government ministries such as Immigration, Customs, and Police and with the support of the Office of Prime Minister to respond to this situation, and measures to prevent the infection from spreading on ship have been implemented on the ship.” MHMS wishes to advise that the sick people on board are, at the moment, only being treated as suspected cases of 2019 novel Coronavirus. The remaining people on board are only being treated as contacts and will be monitored for development of symptoms and provided immediate clinical care should they develop the symptoms. “The ship and people on board will be released from quarantine once it is assessed that they do not pose any risk to general public in Rennell and Solomon Islands. “For people on Rennell, we would like to request you to ensure that the quarantine boundaries are maintained and advise and directions from health authorities are adhered to. They are strictly prohibited from going to ship. The incident does not pose any risk to the residents of Rennell Island and there is no confirmed case of novel coronavirus in Rennell as of now. “The current public health emergency is a major concern and while Solomon Islands has not had a confirmed case of the virus so far, the Ministry of Health and Medical Services is not taking any chances. The health and safety of Solomon Islanders is the Ministry of Health’s main priority. In the meantime, MHMS would like to request that members of the public remain calm and exercise vigilance by ensuring they follow proper hygiene practices. And they are to; 1. Cover your mouth when you cough and sneeze, 2. Always wash your hands with water and soap, 3. Avoid crowded places and unnecessary public outings, 4. Seek medical advice if you have any flu-like symptoms. Call the public health emergency surveillance unit on 23650 or 7522202 and explain your recent travel history. On BBC News yesterday, hundreds of hospital workers in Hong Kong have gone on strike, demanding the border with mainland China be completely closed to reduce the risk of the coronavirus spreading. “Hong Kong has suspended cross-border rail and ferry services, but health workers want a total border closure. “Authorities say closing the border completely would go against advice from the World Health Organization,” according to BBC. At this present, there are more than 17,000 confirmed cases of the virus and 361 deaths in mainland China alone. Outside China, there are more than 150 confirmed cases of the virus with one death in the Philippines, it is reported.",,,,,,,,,56,-1.64

Matthew Wale, has expressed his dismay on what he sees is a case of clear politicization of the medical condition and health woes of the Premier of Malaita Province, Hon. Daniel Suidani. “I am utterly dismayed at the reports currently swirling around in the public domain regarding the manner and the depths by which the government is seemingly willing to stoop to in using the health of Premier Suidani as political leverage,” says Hon. Wale. The leader stated that, “we are a society founded on the values and principles of respect and common decency”. Hon. Wale also stated that, ‘the reported conditionality placed by a couple of Ministers to effectively stage a political stunt involving the Premier and the Prime Minister in exchange for medical assistance is a new low in Solomon Islands politics and leadership”. He recalls that the Solomon Islands is a Christian country with a belief entrenched in ‘love your neighbor as yourself’ - a cornerstone of the Christian faith. “We all know the story of the Good Samaritan. So while there are political differences and world views between us, which is normal in a democratic country, humanitarian support for another human who is struggling with health issues should not be used for political point scoring,” he adds. The Opposition Leader further adds that, “I fear that such action only adds to the notion that perhaps the government may want to see the Premier of Malaita Province succumb to his medical condition than be treated for it”. “This is truly a grotesque proposition. The reports of such a notion is a real stain in the political discourse of our nation,” Hon. Wale expresses. Hon. Wale also adds that, “if the demise of the Premier is the intention of the national Government then I condemn such intentions in the strongest terms possible”. He then points out that the weaponizing of the health situation and condition of a beloved leader for political gain is a dangerous turn of events for our nation. The Leader of Opposition acknowledged, however, the humanitarian assistance extended by the friends of democracy and the Republic of China, Taiwan. “I would like to express my gratitude to the government and the people of Taiwan for your humanitarian assistance to Premier Suidani. Taiwan is a leader on health matters globally and have world class health facilities. Indeed, our current and past national leaders have benefitted from health checkups in the past during their visits to Taiwan,” the Opposition Leader says. He wished Premier Suidani a God speed recovery stating that, ‘I will continue to join Christians in Solomon Islands and around the world to pray for Premier Suidani’s situation and for him to regain his health’.

Seleso, in which the Minister accused Malaita Province of not being prepared to work with the National Government in the fight against COVID-19. This letter has further threatened to dissolve the MPG either through the use of the COVID-19 Regulation under the Emergency Powers Act (EPA), or under the Provincial Government Act (PGA). Legal analysis by the MPG has confirmed that both of these threats are outside of the law and unsupported by facts, and has responded as such in writing to the Minister. Furthermore, given such poor factual and legal basis for such a significant threat, MPG sees this as a bad faith attempt to undermine the provincial government of the people of Malaita. Even worse, this threat can be seen as an attempt to incite ill feeling between the peoples of Malaita and Guadalcanal. The Minister claimed that the PM could suspend the MPG under the EPA COVID-19 Regulations, which is not true. The scope of the COVID-19 regulations do not permit the suspension of MPG or any provincial government for that matter. His threat in this instance was outside of the law. The Minister further threatened to dissolve MPG under the auspices of the PGA. In making this threat, the Minister’s letter quoted the PGA, using the 1997 Act. In his letter he claimed that this was due to a “national security issue for Solomon Islands”. This claim is categorically false. Malaita Provincial Government has been clearly and consistently working with the National Government in the fight against COVID-19. As such it is supporting security for Solomon Islands not undermining it. Malaita Province has been supporting national security and national public health through clear and responsible public messages to ensure quality of COVID equipment, through the careful planning of “100 days of planting” to ensure food security, and through consistent responsible messaging regarding social distancing. It appears that the Minister’s letter was influenced by the Premier’s statements cautioning on the quality of incoming COVID-19 related materials from China. In its response, MPG Premier pointed out that his statements about imported PPE from People’s Republic of China have been clearly made to support public health, not undermine it. The actual reported statement in Solomon Star last month is as follows: ""While we should appreciate any genuine support, we must also be mindful that whatever we are given is workable, applicable and serves the purpose to which it intends to serve and must be internationally accepted and of high quality,” the premier said. “I said this in light of a number of international reports revealing that a dozen countries including, Spain, Netherlands, Philippines, and the Czech Republic's have returned faulty Chinese made COVID-19 testing kits,” Mr. Suidani added. ""The health and survival of our people must not be compromised simply because an irresistible gesture from a friend,” the Premier cautioned. Premier Suidani said that if China is sincere about its assistance to the country, it is only proper that it purchases kits from genuine suppliers from other countries apart from China itself and sends them over to the country. This is clear evidence that my statements were made to constructively support public health and order in our country. This is exactly the opposite of what was claimed by the Minister. The following excerpt from the Premier’s response is included verbatim here for clarity: “The letter makes several claims as well as threats. I write this letter to inform you that the claims in the letter are incorrect at best, and intentionally false and malicious at worst. Furthermore the threats that are contained in the letter are of a grave nature, and based on my legal advice, amount to actions planned outside of the law. I can only assume that your letter has benefited from the advice of the Attorney General and has been issued with the blessing of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. I therefore need to assume that this is the position of the Democratic Coalition Government for Advancement (DCGA). For this letter, after passing through the Attorney General and the Office of Prime Minister and Cabinet, to retain such a degree of misrepresentation of fact and misreading of law leads me to conclude that these inclusions are deliberate.

Mr Sogavare highlighted this when delivering his nation-wide weekly covid-19 address yesterday. He said the decision to repatriate passengers from China and Philippines was taken after a thorough analysis of risks and benefits. “I would like to make it clear that the same treatment is given to all our bilateral and multilateral partners who are needed in the country to advance our national projects and national interest,” he said. The Prime Minister said in fact, other flights to repatriate citizens currently stranded in New Zealand, Australia, United Kingdom, USA and other European countries are also in the planning process. He said these planned flights will also bring in key foreign personnel from our development partner missions to help finance major development projects in the country. “The same arrangement will be done for engineers for TINA Hydro project, the International Airport and the Kukum Highway projects as well as other national projects,” the Prime Minister said. Prime Minister Sogavare said there are no exceptions to our pre-departure requirements as well as our post arrival quarantine and testing protocols. The Prime Minister said all passengers regardless of their nationality or status must undergo strict testing and quarantine protocols prior to and upon arrival. “According to our testing protocols, all passengers must undergo compulsory tests before boarding the flight. Anyone who is tested positive will not board the flight,” he said. The Prime Minister said the Government has acknowledged that this challenging and unprecedented time requires Cabinet to make tough decisions for the betterment of the country. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Sogavare in his nation-wide address said he is fully aware that some Government decisions might not go down well with some of our fellow citizens. “But let me assure you all that all decisions are made after careful assessment and analysis based on evidence,” he said. Prime Minister Sogavare said as leaders of this country, they have been mandated by the people to serve in the best interest of our nation and its citizens. “This is what we are continuing to do. The Democratic Coalition Government for Advancement’s overwhelming priority now is to safeguard our people and also continue to make sure that our economy remains afloat,” he said. The Prime Minister also appealed to good citizens of the country to continue to work together with their Government through these unprecedented times. “We must continue to remain vigilant, steadfast and united,” he said. --OPMC PRESS",,,,,,,,,54,-1.7

The Solomon Islands National Institute of Sports High Performance Center will be built at the former SINPF land is funded by Solomon Islands government. According to the National Hosting Authority (NHA), a board meeting is scheduled for next month and is expected to reveal what plans are in placed regarding Solomon Islands preparations to host the games. “Our next board meeting is in 8th September. SINIS HP staffs are working, setting plans for when facilities are set, trainings will continue,” NHA Chief Executive Officer, Christian Nieng reveals. The High Performance programme started its initial phase of introducing the elite training late last year. However, the Covid–19 pandemic has also delayed its progress. Recruited local staffs help develop programs and services plus volunteers since it’s launching in October 2019. An institution which aids to provide quality training for the sporting industry. The High-Performance training programme includes; Well-being and lifestyle performance, Talent Pathways workshop, Sport business, Performance management and Coach performance. “There are so many amazing things that have never happened in Solomon Islands before are in the programme,” HP Expert, Aaron Alsop told SunSPORTS recently, “and our staffs can’t wait to start trainings and building athletes, coaches and sports managements towards 2023 Pacific Games”. Meanwhile, it had been recently reported that coronavirus is beginning to lead to fears that it could affect the building of infrastructure of the 2023 Pacific Games in the Solomon Islands, even though it is one of only 10 countries yet to have recorded a single case of COVID-19. Several projects are due to be funded by the Chinese Government and were scheduled to get underway this year, including the construction of a new National Stadium in the capital Honiara. But the COVID-19 pandemic means the project team from China - the country where the novel coronavirus originated - still have to arrive in the Solomon Islands to officially begin the work. Preparatory work is continuing to be carried out remotely, but Pacific Games Council chief executive Andrew Minogue has warned that building needs to begin soon if the original timetable is to be maintained. ""By next year I think,” he had told Radio New Zealand (RNZ) when asked when the latest work could begin. ""Mid-2021 gives them sort of 18 months to two years to have the venues ready is sort of a guiding timeline that we've had. ""But as we've seen in other parts of the Pacific, last year in Samoa with the new badminton and netball center [and] a couple of years before that with the Mini Games in Vanuatu, the new Korman Stadium, the donor partners can get in there fairly quickly and build these facilities."" Minogue meanwhile hopes a proposed charter flight from China could be the key to the project beginning properly. ""It's largely for repatriation of Solomon Island citizens that are over there but also I think to possibly bring in some design teams from China to be on the ground and start at the next level of intensive design work for the venues in Honiara,” he told RNZ. ""There is work going on now - it's being done remotely - but it is something that we're being briefed on by our hosts in the Solomon’s and it's a live issue. ""They need to be able to keep going with that programme to get things ready on time,"" he adds.

In a press statement the Government’s Sol2023 National Hosting Authority (NHA) the conceptual designs of facilities have completed. “The application for the building permit for the construction of the Solomon Islands National Institute of Sports (SINIS)/SISLI facilities is pending approval from the authorities, however commencement of the work will depend on the public state of emergency and the situation surrounding our country’s efforts to stop the entry and spread of the COVID 19 virus,” the NHA statement reads. “NHA is ensuring that Geo-Tech and other data required for architects to complete the conceptual designs of the facilities are completed and communicated to PRC and WIKA of Indonesia for them to complete conceptual designs. As soon as we agreed on the conceptual designs, we will apply for building permits from the responsible authorities. “We can only do what we can within our means during these challenging times and we hope COVID-19 virus goes away sooner so that we can return on track with the preparations for 2023 Pacific Games,” the statement adds. September last year, with the funding support from the People’s Republic of China (PRC) a design team from the Beijing Institute of Architect (BIAD) did scoping and feasibility study. Their study lead to the two government’s agreements on the facilities PRC agreed to fund. However, travel restrictions have affected work but PRC government promptly approved Solomon Islands Government’s request for them to finance more than 70% of the sports facilities needed for the 2023 Pacific Games. PRC will finance the national stadium, Swimming pool, tennis courts, warm up stadium that has a running track and football pitch, an 80mx50m multi-purpose hall, hockey pitch and a 1,200 square meter support/office building. “Commencement of the work will depend on the public state of emergency and the situation surrounding our country’s efforts to stop the entry and spread of the COVID 19 virus,” the statement adds.",https://www.facebook.com/theIslandSunNews/photos/a.1969037396760109/2462793967384447/?type=3,,,,,,,,54,-3.04

WORK on the main stadium for the 2023 Pacific Games in Honiara will start soon. Funders, the Peoples Republic of China, announced this week the contractor has been identified. China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC) has won the bid to build the stadium. CCECC are not new to Solomon Islands. They’ve done work here in the past, including the government-funded sports training facility at the old Telekom recreational ground, which is in the final stages of completion. CCECC has exactly two years to complete the multi-million dollar stadium before the games kick off in mid 2023. Two years is not a lot of time. But China has assured the nation the stadium will be ready before the games kick off. That means the Government will have to play an active facilitative role in the whole project to ensure speedy construction. This is a project of huge scale that is set to transform the face of Honiara at its completion. Not only that but its financial impact on the economy will be significant. Already, CCECC says it will recruit more than 200 locals to work on the project. Chinese ambassador Li Ming says the stadium will become a symbol of profound friendship between China and Solomon Islands. Politics aside, let’s embrace the stadium project.

This statement is made in response to claims made by the office of the opposition group that health is far from ready in its preparedness to receive and roll out the vaccine due to delays with appointments of technical expertise to support the government in this regard. On December 7, 2020 the Ministry working closely with its partners has submitted the country’s request to Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a global health agency co-leading the COVAX facility which is a the only global initiative that is working with governments and manufacturers to ensure covid-19 vaccines are available worldwide on an equitable basis. Through the COVAX facility, participating eligible countries such as the Solomon Islands will receive an initial covid-19 vaccine to cover 20 percent of its population free and then able to co-finance the remaining doses with Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance. In addition, the Government is also in bilateral talks with our donors and partners to secure additional supply of vaccine to increase the coverage of vaccination against covid-19. As part of the MHMS preparedness, a National Coordinating Committee (NCC) for COVAX chaired jointly by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Health and Medical Services and the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance and Treasury has already been established, and had its first meeting in the first week of December 2020, where the Solomon Islands application for covid-19 vaccines was reviewed and approved. Members of the NCC includes representatives from WHO, UNICEF, World Bank, Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), People’s Republic of China, World Vision, Solomon Islands Christian Association (SICA) and so forth with technical team comprising of technical staff from WHO and UNICEF. The committee is responsible to; o Review, analyze, guide and endorse technical and operational recommendations for COVAX shared by the Expanded Programme of Immunisation Technical Working Group. o Review global level information (WHO, UNICEF,) related to Covid-19 vaccines and incorporate it into the planning and preparations as needed o Guide the deployment plan with clear functions, responsibilities and deadlines o Establish an operations room for coordination, information and communication o Develop and implement accountability framework for vaccine deployment and use o Report to higher-level authorities, when needed, and communicate with partners and the press o Monitor progress using methods such as dashboard with key indicators, checklists The nature of the cold chain requirement for the approved vaccines present operational challenges. In order to address these, a National Deployment and Vaccination Plan for COVID-19 vaccines has been developed and is constantly being revised to rollout vaccination once vaccines are approved and delivered. The National Immunisation Programme of the Ministry developed the COVID-19 vaccines application and deployment plans with continued technical assistance from the Ministry’s partners regularly interfacing through the technical working group on immunisation. The COVAX deployment and vaccination plan outlines how the vaccine will be received, stored, distributed across the country, administered and the priority persons to receive the vaccine. In terms of the resources and the technical expertise to support the national roll out of the COVAX, the National Coordinating Committee with the technical support team have mapped out the human resource and materials resource needs including the budgetary requirements for an effective rollout of the covid-19 vaccines. While doing so, strategies to prevent duplication of needed specialized technical expertise and overlap of responsibilities were employed. Before the Christmas holidays, the Permanent Secretary MHMS approved the allocation of four additional human resource to the National Expanded Programme on Immunisation unit to assist with COVID-19 vaccination preparation and implementation. In addition, further mapping of existing technical capacities within the Ministry and partners is continuing so that any new appointments of additional expertise are done accordingly to ensure work efficiency and effectiveness as well as sustainability. Thrust is to train and deploy the in-country expertise for sustainable operations under the technical expertise available in-country through the partners such as UNICEF, and the World Bank.

It is said that several meetings have already taken place, with the current Board Chair and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the State Owned Enterprise (SOE) taking lead over the initiative with a number of trips to China for the so-called development of the Ports Infrastructures, both in Honiara and Noro in the Western Province. From information, concern has it that the holdings in revenue of the Ports Authority is more than enough to cater for the developments cost, without having to risk borrowing for it externally on which the question raised is if whether the move for the so-called development of the Ports Infrastructures is necessary. To add, in the move to use China as the SOE’s development partner, it has been revealed that those involved to use China have looked into another move to push for the privatization of the Ports Authority, which currently operates under the government’s control, established with its own Act. PORTs CEO Mr Eranda Kotelawala in response to reports strongly rebuffs them saying these are just rumours with no substance. “Neither the Board nor me have had any discussions on port development other than with ADB. We are pursuing our plans with ADB and they have done lot of work by far in terms on pre-feasibility and feasibility for Honiara and Noro. Our visits to China were to buy the X-ray machine and participate on IAPH (International Association of Ports and Harbors) a regular member. “We are still negotiating with ADB and Government for borrowing, not with any other party. Moreover, we don’t have sufficient reserves to fund all infrastructure upgrades which would cost around SBD 600 Million. Our reserves are much lower than this,” responded Mr Kotelawala. On the alleged involvement of looking into another move to push for the privatisation of the Ports Authority, Mr Kotelawala said, “As I mentioned above our discussions are with ADB at present”. It is reported as well that with the move to push for the development in partnership approach with China, local but senior managers were seen as a threat and were therefore sacked with very short notice. With response to this, CEO Kotelawala said it is also just another rumour. “They had to leave as they had reached their retirement almost 5 years ago. Most of them should have left at the age of 55 but were given appointments by previous CEO Collin Yow. We should give opportunities to other staff. All new positions were filled by our staff within the company. SIPA is 99% local except me the only expatriate. Isn’t that good?” said Mr Kotelawala. When asked on how is the composition and operation of the current SIPA Board, as report has it that it has been running under a three-man watch, without having to fill up the total 5 member spaces provided for in the Act for quite a while now, Mr Kotelawala said “We have done the shortlist already and relevant line ministries will appoint another 3 Directors soon”. Questions are now asked as well surrounding the government’s motives and decisions to allow for the establishment of a privately owned port/wharf in the Ranandi area, owned by Lee Kwok Kuen. This in itself is said should be put under the radar as it may have breached the Ports Act and Regulations, and therefore need answers from both the Government and the Authorities responsible. And when asked on why SIPA is not taking actions against this development when it is their Act that is likely being breached, CEO Kotelawala said SIPA has already written to relevant authorities and they keep pushing this subject. “This private jetty was declared as a sufferance wharf by Customs and they need to revoke it first as it is under their prerogative. We haven't noted any substantial action against this facility so far,” said Mr Kotelawala.",,,,,,,,,51,-1.8

BY TAVAKE SIMON HANA’AROA

THIS year marks another milestone for local entrepreneurs and couple owners of DD Holiday Inn John Deve and his wife Nester.

After almost a year in business, and almost four years from the actual time of planning and putting things together, DD Holiday Inn finally launched its official website. Anyone can access it at https://www.ddholidayinn.sb:=:https://www.ddholidayinn.sb/

John and Nester are the proud owners of the DD Holiday Inn, located at Mbumburu, Lengakiki in west Honiara.

Thanks to the Arietech, a locally owned private Information Technology (IT) Company for creating the website.

For Mr. and Mrs. Deve, it is a milestone achievement, adding that it will contribute a lot to marketing their product – in this case, DD Holiday Inn.

“I am very thankful to the Arietech Company for creating and designing the website.

“It would help to promote the Inn as a genuine accommodation for people can see it, especially those living outside of the country,” DD Holiday Inn Director John Deve said.

Arietech’s Eric Arifanata Junior said the launch of the website is an achievement for the DD Holiday Inn to promote their accommodation so that people outside can see.

“It is just a soft launch, which means it needs a further final touch up before it is complete and other features like online booking will be included as we go along.

“But this is a big achievement for them,” Eric said.

Having an official website is an essential part of the marketing strategy for any hotel business or accommodation in the current technology era.

Digital marketing for hotels and accommodation services has the key to continue sustaining the Solomon Islands tourism businesses in 2020 and beyond.

Mr. and Mrs. Deve were both former public servants who overtime decided on quitting their jobs and becoming full-time entrepreneurs.

John, a former police officer has been an entrepreneur since he was a lad and has been jumping from one business to another along the way.

Nonetheless, he said nothing beats being in the tourism business.

“Ever since I’ve ventured into this industry, this is the best business apart from other businesses that I have been established.

“It is environmentally friendly and causes no damage to the ecosystem,” he optimistically said with a smile.

DD Holiday Inn for sure is surrounded by what nature has to offer.

Nester Deve, on the other hand, is very supportive of his husband’s motives and business career paths.

“This is a family matter so I, including everyone in our family, are obliged to support my husband, our dad through thick or thin.

“We all work together to make this happen where we have witnessed this year (Friday 14th February) the launching of the website,” she said.

Catering and hosting workshops are the two main income drivers for the business since accommodation is not a marketable commodity this time of the year.

If the business meets all the minimum standards required by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and with the help of the website, for sure, it will be meet their specific current market demand.

With her cooking skills, Mrs. Deve is in charge of the kitchen.

“My profession is teaching and I was once a Home Economics (HOME-CO) Teacher.

“I quit my teaching career eleven years ago.

“By venturing into this business and especially in food and pastry catering services, it forced me to recollect all my cooking books and kitchen utensil from the cupboard.

“It also motivated me to utilize my cooking knowledge and skills, which I had (left eleven years ago) from the classroom,” Nester Deve said.

The launch of the website, for them, is just icing on the cake.

The actual happenings, the sufferings, hustling and making things to reach this far started thirty years ago.

“I started my first business straight after I left school and that was in 1990 in Marau Sound, in the far eastern tip of Guadalcanal.

“With only $100 in my pocket, I manage to buy a drum of petrol which costs $97 per drum (44 gallons),” Mr. Deve recounted.

Deve’s petrol sales continued smoothly despite facing criticism from his customers for not selling mixed petrol, however, his next sell was perfect – he now can afford a mix from the profits he earned his previous sales.

He left to join the Police force in 1993 by leaving behind his business to his dad and siblings.

His petrol business thereafter reached a dead end when militants ransacked it during the height of the ethnic tension.

Still in the Force, he then ventures into other small businesses.

From running a fish market to hire, and then taxi services to chattering ships. He even owned a trade shop, DD shop used to be at the Kukum Highway.

He also owned a second-hand clothing at china town and was hit rock bottom as he competes alongside other Asian businesses.

He then sold the entire second-hand shop and invested on a Lucas Sawmill instead, which he started building his...",,,,50,2.27

That’s why China has been the home of the world’s largest number of outbound tourists since 2012. According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization, outbound tourism expenditure grew to 257.7 billion U.S. dollars in 2017 – accounting for nearly 20 percent of the world market – and is now worth 10 times what it was a decade earlier.

Mr Fa’abasua received his letter from Ministry of Provincial Government and Institutional Strengthening permanent secretary, Stanley Pirione on Sunday 9pm, informing him to stop work and immediately return to Honiara due to workloads in the ministry. Provincial Police Commander, Stanley Riolo confirmed the protest and his officers being on the ground to monitor it. Mr Riolo said the situation can turn worse if the government does not respond to protesters’ demand to allow Fa’abasua to continue his job in Auki. But MPGIS PS Pirione said it is a normal thing to recall provincial secretaries back to the headquarters because they work under the ministry. He said PS Fa’abasua was recalled due to pressing issues facing Malaita province so they can re-strategise ways to provide service deliveries. However, Pirione said due to the issue that came out lately, the Public Service Commission and the ministry will consult with Malaita province to sort out the issue. Malaita Premier Daniel Suidani said his MARA Government is saddened by the action of the Sogavare Government to remove its PS. Premier Suidani said the reason for recalling Fa’abasua does not make sense because the province has a lot of workload since the absence of Deputy Provincial Secretary and Treasurer. “I see this as direct action against my MARA Government by a government that is so indebt to China,” Suidani said to those who staged the protest yesterday. “Make no mistake my people, the Sogavare led government do not want Malaita to progress. This action as you rightly stated is a clear message to us that the Sogavare government only interests in making us worst off. “I can see that what you have demonstrated today is clear reaction to the Sogavare Government that is no longer have interest in the affairs of this country but only his political power. “With the arrival of the PRC ambassador it is clear Sogavare have to take actions to please the PRC. There is no question about that,” he said. “But let me assure you my good people that the MARA government will stand with you in demanding for an explanation from the national government of its action. “As you know the MARA government through its Executive has made a resolution not long ago to not allow our PS to be moved from the Province. Clearly the Government is not listening to that resolution,” he said. “I will quickly call an urgent meeting of my executive to look into this issue and make appropriate statements soon. “My good people of Malaita today we are in trying times and we must not lose hope. I can assure you that we will be set free from any decisions that go against us. “Let me assure you also that as long as the MARA government is leading the province we shall not stop fighting any injustices against the government and the people of Malaita Province. “Let us united and stand for our rights. Let us continue to be responsible for our place and for our people,” he said.",,,,,,,,,46,-2

The PPEs include 2500 medical disposable protective clothing, 5000 surgical masks, 500 medical facial masks, 500 medical protective goggles and 100 infrared themodetector. Following the signing, Yao Ming Deputy Head of Chinese Embassy in Solomon Islands stated that the government and people of China is pleased to provide the support to the Solomon Islands government through the Health Ministry to assist in Its preparedness and response to COVID-19. “It is indeed a pleasure to be handing over these PPEs to help the ministry, especially the frontline health workers and their supporting staff, in their efforts to track and combat any entry and spread of this deadly virus as well as enabling them to perform their COVID-19 operations in a safe manner”, highlighted Mr. Ming. He further added that the handing over of these PPEs is part and parcel of the overall support that PRC has continued to render to the government and people of Solomon Islands in light of COVID-19 and more importantly demonstrates PRC’s commitment and dedication towards its bilateral partnership with Solomon Islands. In response, Minister of Health and Medical Services Honorable Dickson Mua acknowledged the continuous support of PRC stating that it will greatly assist the Ministry in its current efforts to ensure Solomon Islands remain COVID-19 free but also provide safety for its frontline and supporting staff when conducting health checks at the borders. “On behalf of the Ministry I would like to thank the government and people of China for this generous donation which will go a long way in assisting the Ministry to effectively and safely perform their duties in protecting and preserving the health of its people”.

Mr. Mua also explained the Ministry’s need to prepositioned PPEs at the provincial health facilities especially those at the country’s borders is also a priority. “With our current efforts to build capacity and enable our provincial health workers to tackle possible entry of COVID-19 by sea, these supplies will go a long way in enabling them to perform their duties effectively in a safe manner”. The first batch of the supplies were delivered from China to Honiara by air in the early May, the others were shipped from China to Port Moresby in Papua New Guinea and arrived in Honiara last week Friday. The PPEs have been jointly checked by PRC and the Ministry of Health to confirm quality, quantity and specification of the PPEs. Ends/// Source: MHMS Media Release.

Since 2011, Fiji has been Indonesia’s closest ally in the South Pacific, blocking every attempt by the United Liberation Movement of West Papua to join regional discussions and gather support for an end to Jakarta’s rule. When Frank Bainimarama seized power in December 2006, Indonesia and China offered his interim government legitimacy which Fiji’s traditional allies withheld in the hope that he would return the country to democracy. At the United Nations, Indonesia supported Fiji’s nominations to key appointments within the UN system, allowing the Bainimarama regime to trumpet – through a controlled media – its recognition on the international stage. In return, Fiji ensured that human rights abuse – including torture and arbitrary killings of Papuans at the hand of Indonesian security forces – were treated in regional fora as “internal matters of a sovereign nation’’.

The government has never released a death toll of the June 4, 1989 crackdown, but estimates from human rights groups and witnesses range from several hundreds to several thousands. China slid into economic chaos in 1988 with panic buying triggered by rising inflation peaking at more than 30 percent in cities. After weeks of protests in the square, troops backed by tanks crushed the demonstrations, prompting global condemnation. Chinese leaders denounced the demonstrations as a counter-revolutionary movement and the ensuing flurry of arrests, executions and exiles frightened many demonstrators into silence. In 2009, reformist Chinese leader Zhao Ziyang broke the official silence on the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown, denouncing the killings of protesters as a ""tragedy"" in recorded memoirs released four years after his death. China's President Xi Jinping has shown no sign that his administration will change their stance on the incident.

The flight to Guangzhou will be on September 1, 2020, whilst the first two flights to Manila are scheduled for September 15 and 18 respectively, with the date of the 3rd flight to be confirmed. A statement from the Office of the Prime Minister & Cabinet (OPMC) stated that the decision was made after careful consideration, which also considered the risk assessment of intending travelers, the covid-19 status in both countries, and our requirement for all travelers to do pre-departure covid-19 testing which must be negative before they can be allowed to travel. “PRC is currently classified as a category-3 country. This means they experience less than 50 new cases of COVID-19 per day. All travelers from category-3 countries, must have two negative tests in the 14 days prior to travel with the 2nd test two to three days prior to departure,” it said. The statement said passengers could only board the plane if both tests are negative. “On arrival in the country all travelers from category 3 countries will undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine period and they will have two further tests which must both be negative before they can be released,” it said. The OPMC statement said as for Philippines, it is a category-4 country. This means the country has more than 50 new cases every day (daily new cases in Philippines averages between 3,000 – 4,500). “All travelers from category-4 countries must have three Covid-19 tests in the 21 days before the flight with the 3rd test to be taken two to three days prior to the flight. They will only be allowed to board the plane if all three tests are negative for covid-19. On arrival in the country, all travelers from category-4 countries will undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine period and they will have a further three tests which must be all negative before they can be released.” The statement adds, for both categories, doctors can keep a person longer than the 14 days and may do additional tests if so required. The maximum quarantine period is 21 days. “All intending passengers from both countries will be subjected to confirmation from the Ministry of Health & Medical Services that all pre-departure health assessment and pre-departure testing requirement are completed, and results sent to our health authority before they can travel. All incoming passengers must be individually approved,” the statement said. “All passengers regardless of their nationality or status will and must undergo strict testing and quarantine protocols prior to, during and after arrival. “According to our testing protocols, all passengers must undergo two tests before boarding the flight from category-3 countries and three tests before for category-4 countries. Anyone who is tested positive will not board the flight,” it said. The OPMC statement adds, the flight to China will be undertaken for purposes of repatriating our Solomon Island citizens. It will also bring in the new PRC Ambassador to Solomon Islands and some members of the Embassy staff, the PG2023 technical team and workers of major Chinese companies working in major infrastructure projects in the country comprising a total of 88 passengers. With regards to Philippines, the statement said about 403 students and dependents are to be repatriated through three charter flights. All students must do three covid-19 test each prior to travelling. It said the ministries of Education, Foreign Affairs and Health are coordinating the testing arrangements with the assistance from the World Health Organisation. The statement highlighted that the Government has acknowledged that these challenging and unprecedented times require Cabinet to make tough decisions for the betterment of our country. “The decision to repatriate our citizens from China was taken after a thorough analysis of risks and benefits. Cabinet is convinced that if our testing protocol is followed with pre-departure testing and post arrival quarantine and testing, we will prevent the introducing covid-19 into the country. The Cabinet believes that we can continue to conduct important business in the country and still keep covid-19 out of our beloved country,” it said. The statement clarified that the same treatment is given to all our bilateral and multilateral partners who are needed in the country to ensure our national projects are progressing. “China does not get preferential treatment as people might like to think,” it said. The statement adds other flights to repatriate citizens currently stranded in New Zealand, Australia, United Kingdom, USA and other European countries, as well as to bring in key foreign personnel for our development partner missions that help finance major development projects in the country are also in the planning process. The same arrangement will be done for engineers (truncated)",,,,,,,,,44,-2.09

A second scoping team from mainland China was supposed to arrive this month after a first scoping team visited the country December last year. Despite the minor setback, NHA Executive Director Mr. Christian Nieng is confident everything will be done on time saying the government is very serious about providing sports facilities for not only hosting the games but also for sports men and women after the two weeks sporting event. Mr. Nieng said while the National Sports Council in the past has done and tried its best to provide facilities and help our athlete’s preparations but to no avail because there was no support from the government, however that is about to change. “The government is putting in place measures to make sure facilities are built and that sports activities are not only active in Honiara but also in all our provinces,” he said on Saturday. “It was not until we have the chance of hosting the 2023 Pacific Games that the government has seriously started looking and showing a strong commitment to have facilities and establish programs to help develop not only our athletes but also our local coaches. “Looking back the NSC has done its best in the past trying to set up federations, activities, building facilities and helping train our athletes without the support of the government. “But now the government has said they are committed to help address these areas in preparation for the 2023 Pacific Games,” he said. While there is now strong support from the government for sports development in the country, it seems some donor countries are already talking about setting boundaries to differentiate the facilities their government will be funding. “I still don’t know the whole details of the MOUs yet but we will get together soon to discuss with these key stake holders about the National Sports Facilities we are going to build,” Nieng said. But with only less than three more years to go, most critics of the government are already predicting the government will likely throw in the towel from hosting the 2023 Pacific Games due to the time wasted on signing MOUs after winning the bid in 2016.

Chair of the Covid-19 Oversight Committee and Secretary to Cabinet, James Remobatu made the announcement in the latest Travel advisory number two issued on 14 May 2020. The announcement is made in accordance to the statement issued by Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare on the 1st of May 2020 on the government’s plans for repatriation. Remobatu said the government is pleased to announce that Solomon Islands will have the capacity to conduct tests for covid-19 in-country by this week. The first repatriation flight for stranded nationals in Australia and New Zealand is tentatively scheduled for 26 May. The flight will be from Brisbane to Honiara. All nationals boarding the flight must have valid Solomon Airlines tickets. The government is also looking at repatriating nationals in covid-19 free Vanuatu and Fiji thereafter. Flight information will be issued as soon as it is finalized. It is government’s standing position to have all returning passengers from overseas to undergo a mandatory 28 days quarantine in one of the state’s identified quarantine facility. The government of Solomon Islands is committed to take measures to prevent importation of covid-19 in the country and prevent subsequent outbreaks. “We urge the stranded nationals to take adequate precautions while being in affected countries and seek immediate medical care in case of sickness,” Remobatu said. The Government of Solomon Islands takes this time to thank the government of the people’s republic of china and the government of Australia for fast tracking the supply of the two covid-19 testing machines. “We thank the nation for its prayers, our gratitude to all receiving states for hosting our stranded citizens. Our respect to the families of all stranded Wantoks for your patience and solidarity. “We urge everyone to remain united in keeping covid-19 out from entering our borders.

He said that he is in Honiara and they are working on the second shipment of materials to further progress constructions. “Materials already arranged with suppliers and soon they will ship to Atori to begin the second component of the project,” Kwalemanu said.

This meeting came after Solomon Islands had switched diplomatic ties from Republic of China (Taiwan) to PRC last September. WUSI was represented in the meeting by President, David Tuhanuku, General Secretary, Tony Kagovai and executive members and reps from Solomon Kitano Mendana Hotel, Pan Oceanic Bank, Guadalcanal Province. Shen Weizu and Shao Hesong represented the staff of PRC Embassy. Shao told the delegation that if there is no coronavirus, the WUSI members should visit China on March. He said the WUSI members will still visit China when the pandemic is over. WUSI President, Tuhanuku said the China relationship with Solomon Islands is very crucial when we are living in an advance world of technology. He said this is important for the Solomon Islands which has her bulk of population in the rural areas. As such, Tuhanuku said WUSI is looking forward to develop the relationship with PRC. General Secretary, Kagovai said WUSI used to be a non-active member of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU). However, with the new relationship with Solomon Islands, WUSI will now be the active member of ACFTU. ACFTU is the nationalised organisation federation of the People's Republic of China. It is the largest trade union in the world with 302 million members in 1,713,000 primary trade union organizations. The ACFTU is divided into 31 regional federations and 10 national industrial unions. The ACFTU is the country's sole legally-mandated trade union, with which all enterprise-level trade unions must be affiliated. There has been dispute over whether ACFTU is an independent trade union or even a trade union at all. Currently, WUSI has 7000 active members from the nine provinces mainly in industries and private sectors.",,,,,,,,,41,-2.24

Here’s a sneak peek at some of the headlines in the Sunday Times – March 14. NEWS: NFP leader Professor Biman Prasad raises a point in the big one on Page 1. Fijians must be made aware of how the proposed Local Government (Municipal Market Regulations) was released, says National Federation Party leader Professor Biman Prasad. Prof Prasad said the Local Government Minister Premila Kumar must clarify who had circulated the regulations to numerous market vendors’ associations for discussion. Mrs Kumar had said that the copies of the regulations circulated among the market vendors was not the final document. PAGE 2: GROWING up on a maritime island in the Lau Group was not easy for Filipe Ratu. But it was this experience that motivated the Naceva villager on Cicia Island to work hard in school. Yesterday, he reaped the fruits of his hard work when he was among 12 recipients of the Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara Education Trust Fund Scholarships and Loans. FIJIANS planning to return to Fiji for personal reasons, such as visiting friends and family, will be required to pay for their mandatory 14-day quarantine. THERE was an increase in the use of methamphetamine in schools last year. This, according to data released by the Fiji Police Force. Police said methamphetamine was first discovered in Fiji in 1978. PAGE 3: TWELVE out of the 237 crimes against children recorded between 2019 and 2020 were siblings related. MINISTER for Women, Children and Poverty Alleviation, Mereseini Vuniwaqa says the Government recognises its obligation to prevent violence against all women and girls. PEOPLE living in poverty and the destitute should be the heart of service for anyone serving the Catholic Church in Fiji. PAGE 4: A TOTAL of 33 mineral special prospecting licences have been issued by the Department of Mineral Resources. While speaking at a public consultation in Lautoka yesterday, acting director of Mineral Resources Raymond Mohammed said the special prospecting licences were different from the mining licences issued by the department. THE Fiji Police Force recorded 20 murder cases last year. A report pointed out the cases had decreased when compared with 2019, when 26 murder cases were recorded. LETTERS TO THE EDITOR: Writers continue to voice their opinions on various issues they feel are important for the nation. PAGE 7: BEHIND THE NEWS with JOHN KAMEA – In recent years our country has witnessed a steady increase in illegal activities and the emergence of new forms of crimes. Violent robberies, sexual assaults, human trafficking and drug crimes have all injected a feeling of fear and insecurity in us and in the communities we live in. INTERNATIONAL: ROME – The big one is on the announcement that most of Italy, including its capital Rome and its financial centre Milan, will have curbs on business and movement intensified from Monday as the government ramps up its efforts to stem a steady rise in coronavirus cases. The country will also be placed under a nationwide lockdown over the Easter weekend for the second year running, the government said on Friday. WASHINGTON - The United States and three of its closest Indo-Pacific partners committed to supplying up to a billion coronavirus vaccine doses across Asia by the end of 2022 at a summit on Friday carefully choreographed to counter China’s growing influence. LOOK BACK IN HISTORY: A MAN who was out fishing discovered a body floating face upwards in the Dreketi River. It was the body of 24-year-old Dharam Wati of Natua. The villager who found Mrs Wati’s body had quickly alerted villagers who later informed the deceased’s husband at their home. The Fiji Times on this day in 1986 reported on the incident. DISCOVERING FIJI: IF you are on Nokonoko Rd and approaching Laucala Beach Estate, Nasinu Town’s premier residential area, the first right turn you come across will take you to Sekoula Rd. From here, the third right turn leads to Tagimoucia Pl, at the end of which, a short dirt track will end at one of Fiji’s cultural and historical gold mines. Virtually hidden and unknown, this is the site of the twin Laucala Beach Ring Ditch Fortification, remains of an old village that was demolished by war in 18th century Fiji. BOLLYBAAT: NEW Delhi - Kiara Advani has the right lines when she opens up about her future plans. She wants to be “that actor who is good in every film”, does not want to be defined by her hits and misses in Hindi film industry. FOOD with LANCE SEETO: If you have never heard of Manchurian chicken at your local Chinese restaurant, then chances are the chef has never travelled to India, as this iconic dish was invented not in China. Here in Fiji, those who are familiar with this stir fry dish have probably met a chef from India who has brought this spicy fusion dish to our shores. So how did a dish with Chinese origins end up becoming a popular Indian favourite?

A spokesperson from the Solomon Islands National Council of Women on behalf of the CSO leaders attending the meeting, said that they have noted the action by the Minister in his official capacity as serious, violating the Public Finance Act of Solomon Islands. CSO Leaders also feel that his action is a breach of his Oath of Allegiance as Minister of the Crown, not being loyal to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II, and in performing his duties of not protecting and serving the interest of Solomon Islands Citizens and the nation. CSO leaders request the Minister to apologise to the nation on behalf of the DCGA Government because of the intended cause of action he took with the Broker by the name of Mr Terry Wong, to deal with few businessmen in China for the purpose of lending to the Solomon Islands Government USD100 billion. “This is a total breach of his Oath and Allegiance and therefore, should do the right thing by apologising to the nation,” they say. Solomon Islands as a sovereign nation must follow protocols in dealing with such serious loan matters on government to government basis and not using middle men with a predetermined 11 percent heavy interest fee, which will benefit only a few cronies to become billionaires overnight if the loan proposal is to be materialised. The Solomon Islands Government does not have the capacity to mortgage such a huge loan, and therefore will commit all Solomon Islands individual citizen, tribal land with its minerals and sea resources thus setting a new suicidal debt trap for all Solomon Islanders and our future generations to come. The CSO group also call on the Governor General of Solomon Islands to summon the Minister because of his negligence and respect of the Oath he took prior to taking up his position as Finance Minister.

NHA recently have locked in all funding donor partners confirmed to kick off facilities constructions on the ground although the State of Public Emergency is still effective. “The Solomon Islands government (SIG), Peoples Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of Indonesia (ROI) has finalized the funding assistance for most of the facilities needed to host the 2023 Pacific Games,” an NHA statement last week reads. “COVID 19 has posed a lot of challenges to the construction of the sporting facilities needed to host the 2023 Pacific Games but a lot of work is going on behind the scene and the donors are doing everything within their means to ensure that the facilities are completed in time before the opening ceremony. Following a visit by PGC late last year the CEO assured the national government that there will still be enough time to prepare for 2023, despite the uncertainty over the spread of the deadly virus. Meanwhile, NHA will be establishing a Games Organizing Committee, especially to oversee the immediate matters of the games.",https://www.facebook.com/theIslandSunNews/photos/a.1969037396760109/2491768711153639/?type=3,,,,,,,,37,-4.43

This is not true. The NDF was first established by the ROC when they provided these funds for discretionary use by the Prime Minister. Previous Prime Ministers have exercised their discretion in allocating these funds. However, when ROC gave these funds they did not require that these funds be used for development projects. This has now changed under the Peoples Republic China but only until 2022. This arrangement is to ensure a transitionary period after we switched diplomatic relations and will end in 2022. However, under PRC, the NDF will only be used for development projects upon application. It says, Opposition MPs may wish to submit their proposals to the Prime Minister’s Office if they wish to. Wale’s false ignorance is shameful. It is NOT the PRC’s intention to interfere with national politics nor an egregious breach of Solomon Islands sovereignty as Mr Wale erroneously claimed. PRC does not even intend this to undermine the government’s ability to maintain semblance of independence in its foreign policy, far from it. These funds are for developing the constituencies through projects. For example, these NDF was used in the Marovo Constituency to connect the hospital to the main power grid, repainting of the full hospital, electrical rewiring and refitting, purchase and installation of ceiling fans and air cons. Hon. Wale was there last week during the inquiry into the Public Health Emergency Bill, yet he has accused the Government of using the funds for political purposes when these funds were actually used to benefit the sick people of Marovo Constituency. The politicization of the diplomatic switch to PRC overt and covert by some of our politicians is becoming childish and tedious. We should all be focusing on development and not on politicking.

The deceased from Guandong Province in China, was employed by the Top Timber Company as the Grading and Consultation Supervisor. He resided at the Top Timber compound where the incident occurred. Provincial Police Commander (PPC) Honiara City Superintendent John Matamaru said, “An initial report states that in the early hours of 7 April 2021, the deceased was seen by a neighbor arriving back home with a female in his car. Few hours later the same witness saw the deceased and the female leave his house and drove out in his vehicle from the Top Timber compound. Later at about 5am the same witness saw the deceased arrive back alone and went straight into his house.” “At about 7am the deceased’s house girl went up to the deceased room and knocked on his bedroom door but he never answered.” PPC Matamaru added, “At 1:30pm on 7 April, a male colleague went to check on the deceased after he failed to answer his phone. The body of the deceased was discovered in his room after his colleague managed to enter with the key located in the car of the deceased.” The body of the deceased was transported to the National Referral Hospital by the St John Ambulance where he was pronounced dead by a doctor. “I want to appeal to members of the public living near and around the area of incident to come forward with any information to help police with their investigation into this sad incident,” said PPC Matamaru.

THE Guadalcanal Executive and Assembly members have paid a courtesy visit to the Gold Ridge Mining site today morning. The team was led by the Premier Francis Sade and his Deputy Premier, Hon. Lazarus Rina. The courtesy visit is part of the ongoing approach that Mr. Walter Naezon, Director of Gold Ridge Mining Limited (GRLM)/ Goldridge Company Investment Limited (GCIL) had with the Guadalcanal Provincial Government in terms of its tax obligations (basic rates, property rates, and business license) since early this year. Now that GP Assembly had passed the relevant ordinances, Mr. Naezon is looking forward to working closely with GPG to ensure both parties are satisfied. Upon arrival, the GPG team was briefed on the GRLM’s history, past challenges, ongoing developments, and future opportunities in the GRML main office. In addition, the GP leaders also learned about the process of the extractions of ores and also the tailing dams. Speaking of tailing dams, Mr. Naezon stated that they are closely monitoring the risks level of the dams to stop another possible overflow like the one that happened in 2016 which resulted in the SIG to declare the site as a “disaster zone”. To do this, Mr. Naezon explained that drains were being dug beside the tailing dams to divert the runoffs from hills during heavy rains. He said “Communities downstream are regularly consulted and informed about the water levels. The diversion measures should give some leverage until proper treatments are completed”. Mr. Naezon then told the GP team “running the only major mining company in the Country is not an easy task, especially when you have to start from scratch”. He explained that Cyclone Ita devastated the mining in 2014, the St. Barbara (Australia company) had sold the mine for only AU$100. “So, there are tonnes or issues; from cultural, social, economics, and legal issues thrown to us at the very beginning!” he exclaimed. However, five years later, the GCIL is redeveloping the mine with loan-contract worth of $823 million dollars. The leading redevelopers and equity shareholders of the mining site are Wanguo International (Chinese miner) and AFX Group (Chinese based Australian company). They had contracted China Rail ($275 million) to start with the production since last year. The GCIL Director then stated that the company planned to recruit 200 plus workers next year, and will increase the figure once the mine is fully operational. The employment priorities will be giving to Guadalcanal people first before other provinces. He explained that this is to address Guadalcanal’s unemployment rate issues. He furthered that GCIL is doing all its best to follow the legal process under the mining laws and regulations in the country. In response, Premier Sade thanked Mr. Naezon for his hospitality during the courtesy visit, and more importantly his determination and vision to redevelop the mining company and prioritize employment to the people of Guadalcanal. He told Mr. Naezon that the current Executive Government is willing to support Mr. Naezon, especially in addressing the ongoing “illegal miners” issue at the mining sites. The illegal miners, according to Mr. Naezon, has posed great health risks for themselves by digging golds in these sites. In relation, the current Guadalcanal Provincial Executive is also proposing a mining ordinance sometimes next year.

The big one is about dialysis and how it has impacted a young man. A 22-YEAR-OLD Lautoka man diagnosed with End-stage Kidney Disease says he feels cheated because medical staff in Lau­toka misdiagnosed him until it was too late. Shynal Narayan claimed that despite nu­merous visits to the Kamikamica Health Centre and Lautoka Hospital, doctors had failed to diagnose his kidney issue. While Ministry of Health’s permanent secretary Doctor James Fong said juve­nile diabetes was rare and difficult to diag­nose, Mr Narayan maintains his family has had to scrape together $400 a week to pay for life-sustaining hemodialysis. In the second report on Page 1, those having legal custody over children could face a five-year jail term and $10,000 fine for negligence over children during a natu­ral disaster under the draft Police Bill 2020. Parents and guard­ians are to ensure that their children are safe out of harm’s way dur­ing disasters. The Bill has received wide public outcry from political parties who have labelled it as draconian and an in­sult to human rights. PAGE 2: FIJIANS have endured too much, says Social Democratic Liberal Party (SODELPA) leader Viliame Gavoka. He made the comment in relation to the proposed Police Bill that was recently launched by the Ministry of Defence and National Security to replace the existing 1965 Police Act. ""It is draconian and should raise an alarm to all right-thinking citizens as it encroaches into civil liberties, democratic values, and fundamental rights of our people,"" he said. WE are always looked at as a woman and not a leader. These were the words of Minister for Education, Heritage and Arts Rosy Akbar while speaking at the Soroptimist International hosted International Women's Day celebrations in Ba yesterday. PARENTS and guardians will face a five-year jail term and $10,000 fine if they fail to ensure the safety of their children during a natural or man-made disaster, states the draft Police Bill 2020. The proposed law requires parents, guardians, or any other person to ensure a child is made aware of adverse weather, natural or man-made disaster. PAGE 3: THE Attorney-General and Minister for Economy Aiyaz Sayed-Khaiyum needs a reality check, says National Federation Party president Pio Tikoduadua. He made this comment while responding to Mr Sayed-Khaiyum's appeal to Fijians who were receiving unemployment benefit assistance through the Fiji National Provident Fund (FNPF) to look for employment. THE COVID-19 pandemic has been a blessing in disguise for musician William Waqanibaravi enabling him to work on his newly released album Rai Lesu. Known in the local music industry as Big Wilz, the Dakuiloa native of Oneata said the pandemic gave him time to finish his album especially after being laid off from Fiji Airways. UNTIL now Fiji has recorded 167 dialysis patients surviving on machine reveals the Health Ministry permanent secretary Dr James Fong. Responding to questions from this newspaper, Dr Fong said of this 106 were from the Central Division while 40 were from the West and 21 cases in Labasa. BACK IN HISTORY: Page 6 - Joe's Farm Supermarket is a well-known shop in Tamavua, and the story behind the success of this business was published in The Fiji Times on July 11, 1984. Things had come a long way for the founders of Joes Farm Produce, Joe Youn and his wife Linda. Mr Joe arrived from China 30 years ago determined to carve a good life for himself and his wife. LETTERS TO THE EDITOR: Pages 8 and 9 – Read letters on various issues that matter to readers. PEOPLE: YOGA has nothing to do with race, it is all about receiving physical and mental benefits. These were the sentiments of Sangeeta Devi Kumar of Kuku, Nausori, a yoga instructor for more than 10 years. At present, she teaches the ancient Indian discipline at the Swami Vivekananda Cultural Centre at the Indian High Commission, Suva. POINT OF ORIGIN: This column comes out every Monday. Read about Geoff Taylor. AFTER calling Fiji home for about 50 years, Mr Taylor has many a tale to tell. There was the time he met movie star Robert Redford at the Savusavu Yacht Club, a plan hatched at the same venue to sail eight-foot dinghies around the world and how he turned an old copra storage shed into a major attraction in the Hidden Paradise of Fiji. And because he did so much over the past five decades, Mr Taylor jotted it all down in a book titled Not My Fault – Memories of a Field Geologist in Fiji. SPORTS: The big one is on soccer. In the tale of two cities, defending Digicel Premier League champion Suva and Western giants Lautoka are currently tied at top of the points table with round one done and dusted at the weekend. Suva and Lautoka booked 1-nil wins yesterday over opponents Rewa and Navua respectfully. There’s so much more to read in your Monday edition.

Minister of Health and Medical Services, Culwick Togamana said this is the first of the many more consignments of COVID-19 vaccine that the government and partners are working hard to bring into the country in its endeavour to protect all of its citizens against the global pandemic. According to the Health Minister, despite the high global demand of these vaccines, Solomon Islands are amongst many countries in the world to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine and also among few Pacific Island Countries to have received the COVID-19 vaccine. “This 24,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine is the first tranche of the 108,000 doses confirmed by COVAX Facility to cover 20 percent of our population. “Those vaccines are provided by Serum Institute in India through GAVI,” Health Minister Togamana said. Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare early this week has as announced that the country is also anticipating 20,000 doses of Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine early next month from the People’s Republic of China. Meanwhile in a special address to the nation today, Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said the rollout of the vaccination program will commence with a launch on Wednesday morning 24th of March 2021 at the central field hospital. Following the launching, Prime Minister Sogavare will lead the nation into the vaccination program and become the first to be vaccinated. “I'm very happy to lead our nation into this vaccination program after the launch on Wednesday morning,” Prime Minister Sogavare stated in his address today afternoon. The vaccination program is expected to be completed within one week and according to PM Sogavare, the vaccination teams and medical teams will then deploy to the western border to roll out the vaccination program along the western border. “Fellow citizens, it is crucial that we commence the COVID-19 vaccination rollout in Honiara so that our teams are seasoned by the time they deploy to the western border, where support facilities may be a little more limited. Prime Minister Sogavare has also advised the public not to be afraid to take the vaccination. “Every medicine we take has side effects. Some of us may develop some mild side effects, such as pain, or each illness at the injection site or a short period of feeling unwell. Such side effects are common in other injectable medicines we take when we are sick. “So far, the serious side effects reported in the media overseas are not directly linked to the COVID-19 vaccines. So I encourage you all to be ready to receive the vaccine when the vaccination teams are deployed to the western border,” Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said.

By U.S. Ambassador to Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu Erin E. McKee This Sunday, July 4th, the United States celebrates 245 years of independence! After a tumultuous start to 2021, we have a new administration and a renewed dedication to restoring America’s role in the world. This is a critical moment for the United States and our global leadership. That leadership requires relentless focus on global crises like climate change and COVID-19. Higher temperatures, rising sea levels, and more intense storms affect everything from military readiness to human migration patterns to food security. As the COVID-19 pandemic has made abundantly clear, our health security is intertwined, and only as strong as our weakest link. Speaking of global linkages, while we celebrate America’s independence this weekend, it’s important to acknowledge we did not achieve that independence alone. We relied on our partners - partnerships between people, allies, and nations, were critical to our country’s birth and to our survival. And they still are. To achieve our national security priorities and deliver tangible results for the American people, as well as for our friends and allies, we must revitalize our international alliances and partnerships. Today, more than ever, America’s fate is inextricably linked to events beyond our shores. We confront a global pandemic, a crushing economic downturn, a crisis of racial justice, and a deepening climate emergency. We face a world of rising nationalism, receding democracy, growing rivalry with China, Russia, and other authoritarian states, and a technological revolution that is reshaping every aspect of our lives. Ours is a time of unprecedented challenges, but also unmatched opportunity. The United States will always promote partnership, not rivalry; prosperity, not dependence; security, not domination; opportunity, not threats. This is what President Biden means by “building back better.” And we all need to build back better to combat the threats we all face and to secure a better future for the planet. But what does that really mean for Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu? First, we will strengthen global health. We have all seen the troubling spike in COVID-19 cases in Papua New Guinea and the government’s valiant efforts to address the issue. Defeating COVID-19 is paramount – as the President has said, this isn’t over until we stop the pandemic everywhere. But we must also ensure our partner nations are better equipped to prevent, prepare for, and respond to future global health crises so we can stop outbreaks before they turn into pandemics that put our safety and prosperity in danger. In PNG alone, we have contributed more than $6.9 million to fight COVID-19 through PPE donations, ventilators, and technical assistance. President Biden announced June 3 that PNG will also receive a significant vaccine donation from the United States – and we will announce more details on those vaccines soon. Second, just as important to our collective futures, we will accelerate the global response to the climate crisis by funding international climate programs, including the Green Climate Fund, to help developing countries implement climate adaptation and emissions mitigation programs. USAID’s Lukautim Graun project will reduce risks to Papua New Guinea’s rich biodiversity, which is among the most threatened in the world. At the national level, we will help promote transparent policies, including environmental safeguards, for effective stewardship of natural resources. At the site level, we will preserve biodiversity in priority locations by supporting local governments, civil society, and communities to mitigate risks and reduce key threats.

WORK on the multimillion dollars Pacific Games stadium official started yesterday. Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare, who was instrumental in bringing the Games here during the bidding process in 2016, was at hand yesterday to officiate in the ground-breaking ceremony. China is funding the project at a cost of around $2.5 billion. Constructor, China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation (CCECC), has exactly two years to complete the stadium before the Games kick off in July 2023. This is a huge project of considerable proportion. It will occupy 26,000 square meters of land, spanning from the King George Sixth School to the lower Panatina campus in east Honiara. More than 110 Chinese engineers and other technical people are already here to work on the project. CCECC is expected to recruit up to 300 locals – both skilled and unskilled – to work on the project. The stadium project will include seven separate sporting infrastructures. They are: A 10,000-seat national stadium which includes 1,000 VIP seats, An Aquatic centre hosting a 50-meter competition pool, and a 25-meter training pool, A six-court tennis centre A full-sized training track and field with a full-sized soccer/ rugby field A 90 meters by 50 meters multi-purpose hall A 5-aside competition hockey field A double story food court and office space building for the Games Organising Committee When completed, the stadium is set to transform the eastern side of the capital. It therefore is only appropriate that it be called the Sports City. The project will allow us to own a modern sports stadium for the first time since independence. The benefits the facilities will bring to the nation – financially, socially and physically – will also be many. It’s a project that is worthy of our thanks and unwavering support. And so we thank China and its people for funding it. For it will help the country to finally host the region’s biggest sporting event – the Pacific Games.",https://www.facebook.com/theIslandSunNews/photos/a.1969037396760109/2777567875907053/?type=3,,,,,,,,26,-6.31

This was based on the Voluntary National Review Report on the implementation of Agenda 2030 Solomon Islands presented in July this year. Addressing the 75th session of United Nations General Assembly in New York, United States of America over the weekend online, Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said seven out of 10 deaths in Solomon Islands are caused by non-communicable diseases. He said it remains the largest single cause of death in the country. “We are seeing increasing numbers of undernourished children and over nourished adults,” he said. In addition to this, Sogavare said the report also highlighted the vulnerability of our economy to external shocks and natural disasters. He said these coupled with the impacts of COVID-19 will continue to affect Solomon Islands for the foreseeable future. Sogavare said the report highlights some of the achievements the country made to date. He said despite the technological challenges, Solomon Islands continue to see an increase in number of children enrolled in the formal education system. “Secondly, we are proud to have established a National Financing Framework for Development which underpins the financing of the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals,” he said. Sogavare said Solomon Islands believes in the importance of Agenda 2030, the Istanbul Program of Action and the SAMOA Pathway in charting the course for sustainable development. “We have factored these into our national development strategy as the path forward for a sustainable future for our people. “I urge all development partners to remain committed to working with us to achieve our aim of sustainable development,” he said.

Sir David highlighted these measures when he declared the State of Public Emergency in Honiara yesterday for citizens to follow orders of the government in the next seven days. The following measures are: 1. Wash your hands regularly with soap or alcohol-based hand rub; 2. When you cough or sneeze, do it into your flexed elbow or use a tissue and dispose of the tissue immediately into a closed bin and wash your hands. 3. Do not cough/sneeze into your hands; 4. Clean your house, office or stores. Disinfect surfaces, tables or work desks; 5. Avoid crowded spaces and practice social distancing of 1.5m apart from the other person; 6. No handshakes; 7. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. The Novel Coronavirus (covid-19) first emerged in China in 2019. The spread of the Virus continued into 2020 and on January 30, 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) declared covid-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (the PHEIC Declaration). The PHEIC Declaration triggered the Solomon Islands Government to introduce Regulations under the Immigration Act 2012 known as the Immigration (Amendment) Regulation 2020 which was intended to restrict entry of persons into Solomon Islands. Sir David said the spread of covid-19 was not contained and covid-19 continued to spread to other countries and this resulted in the increase of mortality rates caused by covid-19 worldwide. In light of the uncontrolled global spread outlined above, WHO on March 11, 2020 declared covid-19 “a pandemic”. Since that declaration, WHO has now confirmed 195 Countries have now contracted the infection including our close neighbours Australia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea and Fiji. In addition to the above, New Caledonia, French Polynesia (Tahiti) and Guam have also recorded confirmed cases of covid-19. Currently, the statistics on covid-19 are 422,566 cases with 18,887 deaths worldwide. A Coronavirus Oversight Committee (the OSC) was established by Cabinet and was responsible for the monitoring and providing advice to the Solomon Islands Government.

Sol2023 NHA (National Hosting Authority) would like to clarify reports regarding the CCECC (China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation) workers dormitory fire accident. The workers accommodation that caught fire was not part of the Pacific Games National Stadium Project. 

Although CCECC is the major contractor for the Pacific Games National Stadium Project, they also have other projects in country. The building that caught fire was used by CCECC during the construction of the SINU Faculty of Education and Humanities Complex project. All workers on the National Stadium Project are accommodated within the National Stadium Project site. No casualty was reported in the recent fire incident.
 
As of now the cause of the fire is unknown and will have to wait for the fire department to complete their investigation. 

NHA Chairman and board sympathize with CCECC for their capital loss.

Sydney Morning Herald reported on Saturday that court has appointed Malcolm Howell to replace former boss of AXF Group, Richard Minfeng Gu, to liquidate the business which collapsed under debts of more than AUD$200 million. Mr Gu refused to provide books, records or company accounts covering the past five years. This has meant that Howell did not have a complete picture of how the company used its funds. However, Director of Gold Ridge Mining Limited (GRLM), Richard Gu assured Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare and landowners yesterday that the current AXF Group restructuring has no impact on the Gold Ridge Project, because: 1. Firstly, Wanguo completed its acquisition of 70 percent stake in the Project in April this year. As such, Wanguo is now the majority shareholder and the main sponsor and operator responsible for the Project. AXF Group’s stake in the Project is reduced to around 20 percent and therefore has a much less significant Project role. 2. Secondly, AXF Group’s internal restructuring has no bearing on the Group’s mining investments (which include the Gold Ridge Project). AXF Group is undergoing group restructuring to consolidate its assets and liabilities so that it can better focus its business on mining investment. This involves liquidating some of the subsidiary companies that are not involved in mining investment within the Group. 3. Thirdly, the media reporting is not factually accurate. The Group has recently replaced its previously appointed liquidator for the Group restructuring purposes due to his ineffectiveness. “We understand the negative media reporting was initiated by the former liquidator following the Group’s decision to replace him. “We fully understand the importance of this Project to the Gold Ridge community and Solomon Islands as a whole and have taken on this Project with a great sense of responsibility and honour,” Gu said. “We remain fully committed to the Project and have detailed plans to recommence the Project for production as soon as possible,” he added. Auyeung Hencent & Day Lawyers firm has been instructed to act for MingFeng (Richard) Gu and companies of which Gu is the sole director including AXF Holdings Pty Ltd (AXF Holdings) ATF Australia Xiang Fu International Trust (AXF Trust), AXF Resources Pty Ltd and other companies. “We have been instructed that over the recent days there have been numerous media publications relating to Gu and his companies and in particular statements made the former liquidator of AXF Group Pty Ltd (AXF Group), Malcolm Kimbal Howell. “In December 2019 Gu transferred the trusteeship from AXF Group to the new trustee being AXF Holdings. From that date, AXF holdings became the group holding company of AXF Resources,” the firm said. Vincent Zhu, partner in the firm said recent media hype has surrounded the liquidation of the former trustee arising as a result of the removal of the former liquidator Mr Howell, who is unhappy about his replacement. “Mr Gu has plans to restructure and consolidate the debts in AXF Group but those plans were not able to be realised due to lack of corporation from former liquidator. “The new liquidator of AXF Group has indicated that he will assist in this debt restructuring and consolidation process and Mr Gu hopes to achieve this within the next 4 weeks,” he said. “AXF resources including the Gold Ridge mining project remain unaffected and business will continue as usual. “Mr Gu is committed to his continuing relationship and work with regards to stakeholders and assures them that the recent events have not real impacted to his commitments and his group’s ability to continue with the project,” he said. Zhu said it is with most regret that the events surrounding the liquidation of AXF Group has been misleadingly described by Mr Howell to the press and that the complaints and allegations made by Mr Howell have been effectively been resolved or dismissed by the court (see AXF Group Pty Ltd & Anor v AXF Holdings Pty Ltd & Ors [2020] VSC 375). According to Australia Broadcasting News, Hong Kong-listed Wanguo International Mining, has contracted state-owned China State Railway Group USD$825million to complete the works over several phases at Goldridge. The previous owner, Australian-listed St. Barbara, sold the mine for a nominal $100 to a landowner group in 2015, and that group went on to secure interest from Australian-based Chinese company AXF Resources, and then Wanguo. Island Sun understands Gold Ridge is venturing to export concentrate gold which is new in the country but not new in the mining industry. The company intends to put the ore on a platform and spray it with acid to produce gold bar before exporting, rather than exporting gold bar straight to overseas.",,,,,,,,,25,-3.68

Deputy Opposition Leader Peter Kenilorea during the question and answer session in Parliament on Thursday questioned an agreement Sam Group signed with the government. According to Kenilorea Jr, the agreement was mentioned by Sam Group in its website. He also question why Sam Group was part of the government delegation. But Prime Minister Sogavare in his respond said Sam Group was not part of his delegation to the Republic of China (PRC) and there were no agreement his delegation signed with this firm. Prime Minister Sogavare stated Sam Group representatives persuaded his delegation and later he had an informal meeting with Mr. Wong Yim Kau, the promoter of Sam Group. “No, we did not sign any agreement,” Prime Minister Sogavare said. He encouraged the people not to believe everything shared through the media. “There are so many rubbish posted in the media where people simply swallow them,” Prime Minister Sogavare said. He said this is worrying because once people continue to rely on the media for everything, over time the country will be influenced by what they read and saw in the media. Sam Group is probably the first Chinese company that welcomes the country’s diplomatic switch to China over Taiwan. Sam Group’s first move here was the signing of a Strategic Cooperation Agreement with the Central Islands provincial government. The signing of the agreement sparked a lot of interest and the Attorney General has declared the agreement illegal.",,,,,,,,,25,-3.68

A statement from the Development Services Exchange (DSE) said at a time when Solomon has confirmed cases of Covid-19 and updates are shared through the platform, the government moves to shut it down is clearly an attack on human rights. the rights of people to express their concerns on issues affecting citizens of this country. It is indeed a sad time for the people of Solomon Islands. DSE understands the Solomon Islands Government is putting a temporary ban on the social media platform after the Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare and Communication and Civil Aviation Minister Peter Shanel Agovaka told Cabinet the forum had been grossly abused by the people, claiming that character assassination, defamation of character are issues of concerns. However, DSE also understands the government itself also uses Facebook widely to disseminate information on public health during the Covid-19 pandemic. DSE has recognized facebook to be a people’s-go-to platform to gather information, updates and share knowledge on national crisis. As the national CSO/NGO umbrella body in the Solomon Islands with a constituency of 65 members the platform is used to amplify their work on the ground and for sharing information. Solomon Islands will now join China, Iran, and North Korea as outlawing Facebook. Other countries have temporarily blocked it, including the island nation of Nauru which prohibited Facebook in 2015 but unblocked access in 2018. DSE expresses concerns that this move will have a huge impact on the work of civil society organisations’ who continue to inform, update the populace given the different sectors they represent from Health, environment and conservation, climate change, advocacy on development issues, youth and women, faith based organizations, media, Human rights advocates, child protection, social welfare, etc. Facebook has been a advocacy and lobbying platform for our members. “Community visitations, monitoring and feedbacks from the people on the grounds especially our provincial NGOs/CBOS, before, during and after any natural disasters, will no longer be shared on Facebook if the ban is going to eventuate.” The Solomon Islands is home to about 685,000 people. While the archipelago stretches across a vast area of ocean Facebook has played a bigger role during Covid-19. “DSE on behalf of its members is reiterating calls by the private sector, Transparency SI, young people and the public for the government to reconsider its decision to temporarily ban face-book. Banning face-book is not the solution, penalizing the law breakers for defamation of characters and character assassination as claimed by the government should be the immediate action and the law enforcers should be put to work to ensure such bad practices are dealt with accordingly” DSE also call on the government to be responsible in putting resources for a mass awareness on how to use social media responsibly if it is serious about the impacts -social media platforms like facebook is or will be having on the country.

Meanwhile, the National Consultant, Fundamental Reform Sector Mr Bernard Bata’anisia said further consultations will be made with other line Ministries and key stakeholders on the proposed work of FPAS and its implementation process. “Under the guidance of Cabinet, FPAS will liaise closely with all key government ministries, provincial governments, State Owned Enterprises, and stakeholders responsible for the implementation of the relevant MOUs and government development polices,” he said.

This was revealed in the Magazine released by Solomon Islands Government on Economic Stimulus Package during the launching at Heritage Park on Monday 4th May. It said the country’s key trading partners in Asia (China, Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore and Japan) are all affected by the pandemic. This is seriously disrupting the supply chain for consumption and investment imports into the country. The impact on trade, commodity prices and volumes, restrictions on international travel and cancellation of flights affecting tourism and movement of people, disruptions to shipping are the channels for transmitting shocks to the Solomon Islands economy. When launching the Stimulus Package, Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said the Covid 19 pandemic is unleashing havoc and generating a lot of uncertainty around the world, including Solomon Islands that requires the government to take a pragmatic and progress approach towards stabilizing the domestic economy while also safeguarding our population from the pandemic. Sogavare said preliminary predictions from Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI) and the Ministry of Finance indicate that Covid-19 is ‘likely to have considerable negative impact on the Solomon Islands economy’. He said the country is heading towards recession in the second half of 2020 with a significant decline in GDP growth is expected to decline further to [-4.9] percent in 2020 as a result of reduction in logging and fisheries exports; a contraction in tourism, as well as the negative impact of containment measures that include suspension of all international flights, entry restrictions of non-citizens and strict mandatory quarantine for all returning passengers “The forestry sector expects an 11% decline in log output, 9% fall in foreign exchange receipts and a 6% drop in government revenue from duties on logs. “With nearly half of the Solomon Islands workforce thought to be directly or indirectly associated with the logging sector, the economic impacts will reverberate across all parts of the country,” he said. Sogavare said the tourism sector is also being hit hard. He said the tourism operators in Honiara predict a 10% occupancy rate for April and the predictions for May and beyond are expected to be lower. “This all points to a dire prospect for the national economy through business closures, loss of jobs, pressure on government revenues, and a serious contraction in aggregate demand,” he said. Sogavare said in their efforts to dampen the impact of the pandemic, especially the immediate impacts, his Government has decided to provide a first round Economic Stimulus Package of SBD309 million or approximately USD$38 million, to ease the fallout of the pandemic on businesses and the general population and to keep the economy afloat.",,,,,,,,,23,-4

THE Chinese embassy held a small event to mark the 2021 International Women’s Day with Chinese and Solomon Islands women at the Iron Bottom Sound Hotel Dynasty Restaurant yesterday.

During the official program, H.E. Ambassador Li Ming in his speech shared his sincere wishes to all women and girls in the Solomon Islands and China.

“I would like to wish all women and girls good health, forever young and to fulfill our common dreams of gender equality and women empowerment,” H.E Ambassador Li Ming said.

He said we should pay high tribute to women in the Solomon Islands and China who are working hard for their families for jobs and better lives for the country and more especially our women who are working as front liners to fight the pandemic of COVID-19.

During the short event, there were also remarks made by women leaders including Madam Emmy Sogavare and Honorable MP Freda Rotutafi Rangirei. They wished all women throughout the country on the celebration of this year's annual event.

After the official program, there was a demonstration on how to make Chinese dumplings, a Chinese traditional food. The women guests watched and tried out how to make their dumplings.",,,,22,1

THE Ministry of Health and Medical Services (MHMS) would like to inform that the first COVID-19 test for all 104 passengers who arrived last week on the China-Honiara flight all returned negative. Additional test conducted by MHMS on the person alleged to have breached quarantine protocols also returned negative. Despite the negative results generated from the test, the individual is now being held in quarantine for further assessment and will follow through the quarantine and testing protocols. Due to the nature of the breach NHEOC surveillance team immediately commenced the investigations which are still continuing. With this, the Ministry of Health would like to strongly advise the general public that the Quarantine Stations are restricted areas and the public is not allowed to enter nor to have any direct contact with any occupant of any Quarantine Station. Any contact is a breach of the Emergency Powers (COVID-19) (No.3) Regulations 2020. Quarantining of arrivals from overseas is established strictly to prevent any contact with those outside of the quarantine stations so that any possible entry of COVID-19 would not lead to spread and community transmission. As per the Quarantine protocols, no item can be sent outside from quarantine station without prior approval from the relevant authorities. Breach of quarantine regulations is not only illegal but poses health risk to our own children, families, communities and the country as a whole. That said, it is of utmost importance that each one of us must cooperate and work together to ensure that our quarantine regulations are respected and fully adhered to in order for the country to remain free from COVID-19.

All the incoming travelers were assessed for the symptoms of COVID-19, temperature check upon arrival and detailed history on testing including documentary proof of having tested for COVID-19 as per the requirements put by the Solomon Islands Government. Health operations at the airport went smoothly and according to the standard operating procedures. Though all arrivals were tested negative for COVID-19 at least twice prior to boarding the flight from China, they are still subjected to mandatory quarantine and health assessment and testing during quarantine as per existing requirements governing entry into Solomon Islands. The usual daily health monitoring for any signs and symptoms of COVID-19 will commence as of today up until the last day of quarantine. Should there be any persons in the quarantine stations showing signs and symptoms of COVID-19, the, person will be examined by a physician at the NRH and tested for COVID-19. Depending on the test report and based on the condition of the quarantined person, appropriate medical management will be carried out.

He won silver medal losing three sets (11-8,11-9,11-7) to his New Caledonia rival of 2015 Pacific Games.

""I'm not retiring as yet, I will still play,"" said Agari. ""I should have done better."" Agari was also congratulated for his efforts by fellow Team PNG table tennis squad members. Coaching in absent of Robert Loi was Agari's nephew Geoffrey Loi. ""My advice to him was not to give up. Fight till the war is over,"" said young Geoffrey Loi who was mentoring 50 year old Agari from the table side.

BY MIKE TUA

THE Green Party Solomon Islands launched its election campaign for the 2024 National General Elections over the weekend. 

The two days convention was held on 22 and 23 May at the Anglican’s St Alban Church compound, Rifle Range, and Solomon Islands Development Trust Conference room, China Town.

68 local participants including key guest speakers, Solomon Islands environmental activist, Lawrence Makili and the Registrar of Political Party's Commission, Jasper Anisi were also present at the convention and they provided insights to attendees on how they prepare ahead for the 2024 National General Elections.

The Green Party Solomon Islands (GPSI) says the convention is aimed for the 2024 upcoming National General Elections, pledging interested individuals to become members of the Party.

The slogan of the convention – ‘Challenges the Green Philosophy to face in today’s Political Environment’ aims to campaign on delivering a greater change for the future of Solomon Islands and also a detailed action that is needed to address ‘environmental issues’.

We give our sincere gratitude to the Government and the People’s Republic of China through our ambassador, together with the Prime Minister, Voreqe Bainimarama for the generous donation. The Chinese ambassador linked the grant to China’s One Belt One Road programme and the Marist gift is a China Belt Road Initiative. Funded by the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), China’s development outlay from Asia to Africa will be US$1 trillion (FJ$2.08tr) by 2020. A new chapter of economic development and prosperity greets developing nations on a scale not fully understood by many today. Neighbours, Australia and New Zealand, are among the first to join the AIIB. As students of MBHS in the early 1950s, the school, through that ground, developed great teams in athletics, rugby, soccer and cricket. Athletic high performers like Sakiasi Nagani Vavulagi, Joe Tokuna, Karen Mafatolu, Dan Veitata, Jone Makasiale, John Vavala and many scores of athletes pounded the turf of the ground with training sessions and practices. Holistic education was the theme. Academic performance, with time, was matched by sporting activities and record results. A multiracial school with highest order at the time. The Chinese Government at the Beijing Olympics spent US$62 billion (FJ$128.74bn) on their Olympic complexes. Their performance at the World Olympics speaks for itself. Fiji looks forward to a long and happy relationship with the Chinese Government. As for the Prime Minister, words of gratitude are not enough.",http://fijisun.com.fj/2018/06/19/letters-to-the-editor-19th-june-2018/,,,fijisun.com.fj,,,,,18,-25.89

BY ALEX DADAMU

Today marks a significant day on the road to SOL2023 Pacific Games, as a ground-breaking ceremony is hosted for construction to commence on the KGVI East and KGVI West sporting facilities.

Speaking during the ceremony today, Prime Minister, Manasseh Sogavare urged China Civil Engineering Construction Company (CCECC) to deliver the projects within the agreed 24 months projection.

CCECC Country Manager Mr. Huang Pengfei, in a very short response to the PM said they will deliver the projects on schedule and with the required quality.

According to a National Hosting Authority (NHA) statement today, Mr. Pengfei, stated that CCECC are expecting the KGVI East running track and football field to be completed by the end of this year.

Mr. Pengfei further stated that the officially handing over of all the sporting facilities and complex to the Solomon Islands Government is expected to be done by May 2023 before the Pacific Games opening ceremony.

In the meantime, CCECC are looking to employ local workers in the field of steel bar works, bricklaying, carpenters, paint workers and unskilled construction workers. As the projects expand, CCECC are expected to employ up to 300 local workers.

Sol2023 XVII Pacific Games ground-breaking event today was attended by the Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare and Deputy Prime Minister Manasseh Maelanga along with Members of the Parliament, various members of the Diplomatic corps and other stakeholders.

I’ve been doing this since October 2019. We heard about coronavirus first from social media, and then we were formally notified by the WHO in January 2020 about the possible ongoing global outbreak. At that time, it was only China, and then they started to investigate the borders. That’s when we started to pick up. So, our first meeting for the Health Taskforce was held in that same week. This Taskforce includes all of the agents for the vessels. The fishing vessels, the cargo, and the petrol boats. And even the Airport and Immigration were also involved as well as Customs, Agriculture, and all the Foreign Affairs Officers at the Airport. We all met together with our technical people here in the hospital. So, we met up and had to come up with our plan on how we could respond or prepare in terms of coronavirus.

We have 2 objectives. We want to strengthen the public-health coronavirus response system. That’s more the public-health side. That includes how we prepare and secure our ports: the seaport and the airport. We also have to get more stakeholders including businesses and all the other Government departments and community leaders involved in the Health Taskforce. We meet every week, and we are constantly updating our activity plan. We also have to cover risk communication. We have to inform the public and raise awareness through radio and TV and any source we can use to reach the public. Also, under public-health coverage, we have to participate in community engagement. We have to include the media, church leaders, and all of the relevant people. We’ve been successful in most of these public-health tasks.

Aside from our Health Taskforce, we also have a National Taskforce. It includes the same members as the Health Taskforce, but it also consists of the Cabinet and all of the Secretaries in all of the Departments. That Taskforce has met twice now. They are the ones making most of the decisions. Whatever the National Taskforce is trying to plan, the Health Taskforce implements. We brief the entire Government with whatever we’ve planned so far and where we are so far and update them on coronavirus. Because there’s lots of social media news and false news. We are the ones providing reliable sources of information. We’ve been working with the Ministry of Justice, Communication and Foreign Affairs, and what we do involves the Police. Ultimately, our first goal is not to let the coronavirus set foot in Tuvalu. We have lots of travel restrictions in place, and anyone who tries to come to Tuvalu from a high-risk country has to spend 14 days in a non-high-risk country. Even our Ministers, our Minister of Health and our Secretary, went to Fiji to talk with the Minister of Health in Fiji and Fiji Airways to strengthen the enforcement of our regulations so that everyone respects the 14-day rule.” Dr. Christine Lifuka",,,,16,-2.25

On Friday 6th November, the PRC Embassy in Honiara handed over 1000 disposable masks, 100 hand sanitizers and 50 T-Shirts to the MASI Vice President, Mr. Douglas Marau. Mr. Marau on behalf of MASI thanked the PRC Solomon Islands Embassy Second Secretary Mr. Shen Weizu for the kind donations. Mr Marau said the donations are timely, as the country now records confirmedcases of COVID-19. Marau said in the fight against COVID-19 in the country, journalists are also playing an important role as front liners. “Our local journalists are also front-liners and we must continue to appreciate them for going out into the field, gathering information and keeping the public informed on a daily basis,” he said. “The donations will greatly equip local journalists in ensuring they are safe while reporting on COVID-19 in the country,” he said. Since Solomon Islands recorded confirmed cases in the past few weeks, most gatherings and events are now requesting people to wear masks. During this COVID-19 pandemic, media organizations are also faced with challenges to maintain their operations thus such requirements, though small, are often overlooked. Therefore, Mr Marau said the need for journalists to be well equipped is necessary while carrying out their duties. Meanwhile, Mr Weizu said the PRC is honoured to support MASI. He said the donations although small is aimed in supporting the role of local journalists in Solomon Islands. The masks and sanitizers will be distributed to the various media organisations this week. ENDS///With pictures.

Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare said there are a number of protocols put in place for international travel through the airport, and best practice will lessen the risk of introducing covid-19 into the country and any country outside Solomon Islands. “We are prepared for and can identify and manage the risks through our international airport and seaports. “However, we cannot totally control the frequency and magnitude of illegal border crossing at our western border. With the increase in cases in PNG, this now constitutes the highest risk for transmission of COVID-19. This is where our focus should be while at the same time keeping our guards up on all international travel,” he said. Sogavare said there were a lot of discussion on the social media focusing on risks of brining the COVID-19 virus from China, it is important to understand the greatest risk of transmission is through the western border of Solomon Islands. “In actual fact, Philippines and Indonesia poses a higher risk than China. That said, we also need to repatriate our citizens from China as well. They have the right to be repatriated just like our citizens in other countries. “Let me remind you that the Government with all its agencies are committed to keeping our country safe from the virus.

Bula Vinaka,
 
The COVID-19 global outbreak has recently been declared a pandemic by the WHO, and our teams have been reviewing the situation on an hourly basis. The virus is now present in the majority of nations and territories on Earth, with over 140,000 cases confirmed. 
 
As of 5pm today, Fiji does not have a confirmed case of COVID-19. We should all be grateful for the diligence and vigilance of those on the ground working to buy us vital time to prepare. We must take advantage of this precious time we have been blessed with by acting now to reduce the chance of this virus spreading when it arrives in Fiji.
 
Our travel restrictions on Italy, Iran, South Korea and mainland China remain in full effect, as do the stringent screening measures at our international airports. We plan to install thermal scanners at our international airports. From tomorrow, cruise ships will be banned from berthing anywhere in Fiji. Also from tomorrow, international events will not be allowed in Fiji and local events will be closed to all guests coming in from overseas. 
 
Ministers, civil servants, Permanent Secretaries and staff of statutory bodies will be restricted from travelling overseas barring exceptionally critical circumstances. 
 
We also highly discourage all Fijians from travelling overseas. If you do choose to travel anywhere outside of Fiji, you may be required to self-isolate for 14 days upon your return to Fiji, even if you are not displaying symptoms of COVID-19. This, of course, is already mandated for Fijians arriving home from nations on our restricted travel list. 
 
These measures will all be subject to review as the global situation evolves. 
 
We already have secure isolation facilities up and running throughout Fiji, with the Central Division being served by Navua Hospital, the Western Division served by the Nadi Hospital, and Labasa Hospital serving the Northern Division. As we monitor the situation, more isolation units will be established as the need arises in accordance with our expansion plan. 
 
As of the 15th of March at 5pm, Fiji remains coronavirus-free –– and it is on that basis that we’ve developed these measures. If and when we see our first case, far more stringent measures will immediately come into effect to aggressively prevent the spread of the disease, as other nations have done, such as bans on local gatherings. 
 
While we may not yet have a case, now is the time to begin changing the ways we go about our day-to-day lives to strengthen our resilience to an outbreak. 
 
The single most important thing anyone can do is to wash your hands with soap and water on a regular basis. The combination of soap and water kills COVID-19 dead in its tracks. I’m asking everyone watching to help me carry that message to every man, woman and child in Fiji. Thorough and effective handwashing takes 20 seconds –– and with this simple act, you may very well be saving a life. We’ll also need to break the habit of shaking hands, hugging and sharing takis and bilos. Instead, simply share a “bula” from a safe distance and limit in-person contact as much as possible. 
 
This isn’t just about protecting yourself, this is about responsibility –– your responsibility to the well-being of the countless Fijians who you cross paths with every day. Do it to protect the elderly woman you walk by at the market, the man with a pre-existing heart condition who rides the bus with you, or the grandparent who you look after.  
 
While the steps we can take as individuals are critical, to be effective, the preparations for COVID-19 must be society-wide. We need everyone aware of the risks and actively participating in our national response.
 
Because the sobering reality is that, while we have yet to see a case in our country, our population is already vulnerable to coronavirus. Those with preexisting conditions and NCDs –– like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer –– are at a higher risk of death by COVID-19. So, I encourage all Fijians to use this moment to make lasting lifestyle changes to improve your health –– by doing so, you are guarding yourself and those you love from communicable viruses, like COVID-19, and non-communicable disease alike. 
 
To maximise our larger prevention and containment efforts, we’ll continue to work closely with our hotel and tourism partners to help identify, isolate and treat any visitors who may be experiencing symptoms of the virus. With our flows of tourism under close supervision, we will continue supporting the tens of thousands of Fijian families who depend on the tourism sector for their livelihoods.  
 
As we work hand-in-hand with our tourism operators and other business leaders to combat the coronavirus, we hear their very serious worries about the impact the situation will have on their business. As the outbreak worsens and travel restrictions heighten, people are travelling less. Supply (truncated)",,,,12,-3

Amongst reading about how this is Australia’s biggest foreign policy bungle since WWII, or how Australia’s refusal to take any real steps to tackle climate change has precipitated a revolt from the Solomon Islands Government, it has been interesting to read – or more accurately not read – about what level of responsibility the Solomon Islands Government bears in this turn of events.

Surie writes: ""Beyond semantics and altruism, India’s vaccine diplomacy serves as an effective tool and instrument of Indian soft-power and influence, serving to cement and deepen ties in India’s neighbourhood and Indo-Pacific. India has lobbied for years to secure a seat on the UN Security Council and has been building ties with smaller developing nations particularly in the Indian and Pacific ocean regions. India’s vaccine diplomacy could translate into critical votes at a time when India has secured a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council and is scheduled to host the G20 summit in 2023. The goodwill India earns through its vaccine diplomacy could pay dividends in the future. ""India’s vaccine diplomacy also comes against the backdrop of increased geopolitical tensions with China. In the wake of last year’s protracted border dispute between the two countries, Prime Minister Modi emphasised the need for India to be “atmanirbhar” (self-reliant) in the production of goods and services and play a more critical role in global value chains.

Here are some headlines in The Fiji Times’ Monday edition – March 22. NEWS: The big one is on: # UNDER the proposed Bill Number 50 of 2020, the Supervisor of Elections and the Electoral Commission have powers to fine and jail persons publishing materials undermining public confidence on his duty and function. Those found guilty of this offence could be fined $50,000 or serve a jail term of five years or serve both penalties under the proposed Bill. The second story is on: # THE independence and transparency of electoral procedures had been widely questioned during the Electoral Amendment Act submissions in Wailotua, Wainibuka last week. While submitting to the Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights, the former presiding officer at the area's polling centre, Biu Solia revealed the vote count she recorded at the centre during the last elections were inconsistent with those announced at the National Polling Centre. Villagers had also questioned the reliability of the digital voting equipment used in the counting of votes. They had also raised their concerns on the transparency of procedures during the transportation of voting boxes from polling stations to the national centre. Responding to these concerns, committee chairman, Alvick Maharaj assured villagers their submissions would be presented in parliament in a report. Mr Maharaj and his team were in Wailotua Village on Monday last week to hold consultations. There’s more on Page 3: # THE Supervisor of Elections will have the powers to order the removal of any materials that he thinks is in breach of campaign rules, states a proposed law that is now before the parliamentary Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights. # More than 170,000 people did not cast their vote in the last elections, said parliamentary Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights chairman Alvick Maharaj. For this reason, Wailotua villager in Wainibuka, Sanaila Rasautale said it was important that Government extend the polling day to two or three days to enable the people of Fiji to cast their vote. # PROVISIONS in the Electoral Act demanding politicians to declare their assets and other financial status is nothing short of belittlement and public shaming, says a Wailotu villager in Wainibuka. Presenting his submissions to the parliamentary Standing Committee on Justice, Law and Human Rights on Tuesday, Osea Vutikalulu said there were those that did not have money but had leadership abilities. # Villager, Peni Taucake said the voting boxes needed to be escorted by presiding officers, party agents and police officers to ensure that they were not tampered with. Mr Taucake said having civil servants escort the boxes was a conflict of interest as they had the best interest of their employers. Responding to these submissions, the standing committee's chairman Alvick Maharaj said they would discuss them with the Supervisor of Elections. # Villager, Etonia Tamani asked the committee for the constituency electoral system to be reinstated as constituents representatives were well versed with the issues that affected their people. Mr Tamani said it was hard to consult the current representatives to parliament with issues that affected people in rural areas because ministers did not understand the problems they were faced with. PEOPLE: In the popular People column, read about: # Semi Suveinakama grew up in Waiqanake Village, Suvavou, just outside the Capital City, Suva, home to people who make a living fishing at the Suva Harbour and traditional fishing spots further away. He is turaga ni mataqali and a turaganikoro in Waiqanake. This newspaper caught up with the 57-year-old, who fondly recalls his school days and his hardworking parents, who always reminded him to work hard in school. POINT OF ORIGIN: Read about: # YEE Wah Sing remembers a very different Fiji to the country that exists today. Born and bred in Lautoka in the late '50s, the now 64-year-old has lived in Veisari before settling in Lomaivuna. Mr Yee said his father used to work at a laundry in Suva whose core business was washing the uniforms of American soldiers stationed in Fiji during the latter part of World War II. It was the first business his father engaged in after arriving in Fiji from Guangdong Province, China, just before World War II. SPORTS: # SUVA lucky charm Shahil Dave scored his first yet, most important goal of the season to secure a 1-0 win over Navua during their Digicel Premier League clash at the ANZ Stadium yesterday. There’s much more to read inside. Get a copy to know what we are talking about.

Organised criminals with links to the Chinese Communist Party are trying to find a way in — and many in the local elite have welcomed them, reveals The Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP). In 2019 and 2020, Palauan law enforcement detained and deported hundreds of mostly Chinese citizens working in illegal online gambling operations based in the country. The operations are just the latest in a string of questionable ventures by ethnic Chinese business people in the country, including U.S.-sanctioned senior triad figure Wan Kuok Koi, also known as “Broken Tooth”. Palauan authorities believe the plans are interlinked, and tied to influence efforts by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The Chinese push into Palau has been facilitated by longtime Chinese expatriates in the country, as well as members of the local elite. Among these prominent locals have been two former presidents, Tommy Remengesau Jr. and Johnson Toribiong. By Bernadette Carreon (OCCRP), Aubrey Belford (OCCRP), and Martin Young (OCCRP) The Pacific nation of Palau is a place where newcomers tend to stick out. So locals noticed when scores of young, mostly Chinese citizens started arriving in 2018 and 2019 and sequestered themselves in rundown buildings in and around the country’s main city, Koror. Unlike the planeloads of tourists that visit the country for its famed limestone islands and unspoilt reefs, the new arrivals didn’t see the sights. Instead, they stayed inside all day, their needs met by regular deliveries of food and sex workers. Police investigators soon worked out what was going on: They were low-paid workers who had been brought in to staff illegal online gambling operations, targeting customers back in China. Law enforcement came to believe the operations were connected to Chinese gangsters who in the previous years had become an increasingly menacing presence on the country’s streets. Brusque men with visible tattoos would “just cut right to the [front of] the line and drive down the streets like they own it,” said the country’s police chief, Ismael Aguon. “These guys were up and in your face.” On New Year’s Eve 2019, they decided to act. In coordinated raids on three buildings, officers arrested 165 people found in rooms fitted out with laptops, mobile phones, bunk beds, and stashes of instant noodles and soft drinks. The number of people arrested was more than double the usual population of the country’s single jail, Aguon said. The police chief said he had no choice but to give the detainees a citation for working illegally and deport them back home. The force was so overwhelmed that a proper investigation and extensive questioning would be impossible. “Where was I going to put these people?” he asked. But Palauan law enforcement had come across something far bigger than a few isolated criminal outfits.

Director National Traffic Department, Superintendent Fredrick Satu says, “A RBT test was carried out on the police officer and the level of alcohol present in his blood at that time was 0.136%. This was very high and that he should not have been driving. Traffic officers arrested him for presence of alcohol in his blood.” “The police officer was off duty at that time and was driving a private vehicle,” said Superintendent Satu. He added, “Prior to the arrest, it was reported to China Town Police Post through a phone call that there were two persons allegedly arguing with security guards at the Bulaia Motel in Central Honiara. Police went to the scene but the two people have already escaped.” “Police intercepted both men who arguing with security guards at the Bulaia Motel opposite the Multipurpose Hall at Lawson Tama, approached them but because they were drunk, both did not obey instructions. Police arrested them and escorted them to the Honiara City Central Police Station watch house for further dealings.” Superintendent Satu said, “As we are approaching the festive season, a lot of events and celebrations will be happening. I urge my colleague police officers to be role models for our people and do the right thing – Do not drink and drive. This is applies to all vehicle drivers using our roads.” The officer has been formally charged and will appear in the Honiara Central Magistrates’ Court on 24 November 2020. The incident has also been referred to the RSIPF’s Professional Standard and Internal Investigation (PSII) for further investigation.

 FOREIGN VESSEL BARRED FROM PORT ENTRY.

Solomon Ports in collaboration with the Solomon Islands Maritime Safety Administration (SIMSA) today have taken the decision to deny of entry into port to the Bulk Carrier Vessel MV. Worship Light. 
This comes after the vessel violated international and domestic maritime regulations.
MV. Worship Light left ZHANGJIAGANG, China on the first of April, 2020, and arrived in the country on the 15th of April , 2020.
On 15 April 2020, the MV WORSHIP LIGHT entered the port of Honiara in Solomon Islands and anchored in the harbour area with no authorisation of the Solomon Islands Port Authority and failed to provide pre-arrival information despite request of the Port Authority and in accordance to the Maritime Safety Administration (Ship and Port Security) Regulations 2011.
The following security regulations as per the International Ships and Port Facility security code (ISPS) and PFSP have been violated.
• Section 5.8.1 (PFSP) “The Port Pilot controls the movement of vessels entering or leaving the port.
• International Ships and Port Facility security code (ISPS) regulated that ships must report their intentions to enter a port 72 hours before arrival.
• Any regulated ship that intends to visit the port, must be notified for clearance before entering the port.
• Section 5.9.1 (PFSP), International ships intending to enter Honiara Port must notify the PFSO 72 hours prior to arrival. Ship profile must be screened by the PFSO to ensure the ship is compliant  to ISPS Standards and that is safe for pilot to board.
With the current state of emergency imposed in the country and the global Covid 19 pandemic, Solomon Ports view the ship’s behavior as suspicious and a threat to the country’s security.
SIMSA has also requested the ship to leave the Solomon Islands waters immediately.

Solomon Ports strongly urge local shipping agents to ensure ships entering the country’s waters must abide by our maritime laws.

However, all Fijians should avoid all non-essential travel.

For the time being, the judiciary will continue to function, but there will be no movement of people in remand centres into or out of the Greater Lautoka Area. • Fever clinics will be established in each Division, designed to keep people with fevers away from vulnerable people who visit Health Centres and into separate, dedicated spaces specially designed to effectively identify possible COVID-19 cases.",https://www.facebook.com/207532522613024/photos/a.207535979279345/3119908364708744/?type=3,,,Fijian Government,"PM BAINIMARAMA’S STATEMENT ON THE FIRST COVID-19 CASE IN FIJI

In the early hours of this morning, Thursday, the 19th of March, Fiji confirmed its first case of the novel coronavirus, known as COVID-19. This is an event we have expected and spent months preparing for – and it is an event we are dealing with decisively. 
 
The patient in question was identified, isolated and tested Tuesday evening at the Lautoka Hospital. The patient remains under close medical supervision and he is in stable condition. The case was transmitted while he was travelling abroad; there remain zero confirmed cases of local transmission in Fiji. 
Upon confirmation of COVID-19, the Ministry's highly-trained contact team –– which effectively contained last year’s measles outbreak with the same contact-tracing methods –– was immediately put into action to identify all those with whom the patient has been in close contact. Those points of contact are currently being sought out and quarantined. The capacity of our contact team has been further strengthened by the Republic of Fiji Military Forces and the Fiji Police Force, heightening our capacity to trace and quarantine all those potentially exposed to the virus. 
 
My fellow Fijians, while this is our first confirmed case in the country since its origins in China in November of last year, COVID-19 is now a widespread, global pandemic. Nearly every country has already reported cases of the virus, including multiple Pacific Island nations. Our constant monitoring of the global spread of the pandemic has given us a clear idea of what is necessary now to prevent a large-scale outbreak in Fiji. 

From midnight tonight, our border restrictions on mainland China, Italy, Iran, Spain and South Korea will be extended to foreign nationals who have been present in the United States of America and all of Europe, including the United Kingdom, within 14 days of their intended travel to Fiji. Also from midnight, anyone entering Fiji from any overseas destination will be required to self-quarantine for 14 days, meaning they must stay in one place and avoid contact with others or going out in public as much as possible. Doctor Aalisha will explain later exactly what self-quarantine measures entail. Taken together, these new travel restrictions are the strongest and widest reaching in Fijian history. 
 
The first case is identified in Lautoka, and that is where the most stringent local travel restrictions will take effect. Starting tonight at midnight, all schools and non-essential businesses within the Greater Lautoka Area will be closed until further notice. We’re defining the Greater Lautoka Area as the area spanning from King’s Road at Nacilau Junction past Matawalu Village, to the feeder road at Vakabuli Junction, to the Queen’s Road at Natalau Junction. Banks, supermarkets and pharmacies –– and other essential businesses –– in the Greater Lautoka Area will remain open. Essential businesses include air and rescue services, air traffic control services, civil aviation, telecommunication services, food and sanitary manufacturing plants, electricity services, emergency services, fire services, health and hospital services, lighthouse services, meteorological services, mine pumping, ventilation and winding, sanitary services, supply and distribution of fuel and gas, power, telecommunications, FNPF and FRCS, the civil service, and the private security services, garbage collection, transport services and water and sewage services.
 
Fijians who work –– but do not live –– in this area should report to the nearest office outside of the monitored area, regardless of whether their industry falls under the essential businesses list. If there is no branch of your company outside of the Greater Lautoka area, please contact your employer and government will, in the next few days, announce how your absence from work will be treated during this situation. We advise all employers to accommodate the needs of your employees and not make any employees redundant. 
 
Basically, if you are living in the Greater Lautoka Area, you will now stay in the Greater Lautoka Area. If you do not live in Greater Lautoka Area, you cannot travel there, even if you work there. 
 
By continuing these essential services, we will ensure the supply of food will continue to be available. In order to maintain food security, the Agriculture Marketing Authority will be buying fruits, vegetables and root crops at the border of the Greater Lautoka Area from the farmers and middle-men to be sold to the vendors for sale at local markets in the Greater Lautoka Area. The Minister for Agriculture will provide the specifics of this programme later today.
 
Outside of these containment measures in the Greater Lautoka Area, our nationwide efforts to contain COVID-19 are also being drastically expanded, effective immediately. Gatherings of 20 or more people are now banned. Gatherings are defined as any assembly of individuals in a single (truncated)",,,,8,-4.5

Following the recent political fall-out in Australia because of the China-Solomon Islands signing of a Treaty, and regardless of who wins the forthcoming elections tomorrow, there is now the possibility of a new era strengthening the ties between Australia (and New Zealand) and Pacific Island Countries. The Solomon Islands Debacle In recent months, Australian politics has been in turmoil because of the signing of a treaty between Solomon Islands and China. There is a clear perception in all sides of the political spectrum in Australia that this treaty, whatever it has in store for the future presence of China in the Solomon Islands, weakens Australia’s geostrategic position in the Pacific and allows China a “foothold” which could conceivably be used for military purposes in the future. This military possibility has been denied by the Solomon Islands Government, which sees the West’s concerns as paternalistic and interfering with the Solomon Islands’ sovereignty and its right to diversify is relationships with any international powers, including China. Solomon Islands sees China as a new and strengthening development partner in aid, infrastructure development and investment, especially through links with China’s Belt and Road initiative. The U.S. and Australia both sent delegations to convince the Solomon Islands to not sign the treaty- to no avail. So what now for Australia and NZ? The Morrison Government repeated all its previous rhetoric of their strong ties to their Pacific through their “vuvale” or family, a concept that most Pacific Islanders saw as quite empty given the usual treatment of Pacific Islanders by Australia. But there is a new ball game in town from the 2022 Elections jousting between the major political parties. The Australian Labour Party has announced a set of new initiatives to strengthen Australia’s position in the Pacific, and some may indeed do so.

The ‘Indo-Pacific Strategy of the US’ (IPSUS), specifically under ‘Our Indo-Pacific Strategy’, Objective No. 1: Advance a free and open Indo-Pacific, states, for example: “We will build support for rules-based approaches to the maritime domain, including in the South China Sea and the East China Sea.” Lyle Goldstein of DefenseNews.Com referred to rules-based approaches (RBA) in his critique of IPSUS – see my IB article of April 2022 issue (Indo-Pacific Strategy of the United States: Too Anodyne to be Utilitarian). He wrote: “Acute issues ranging from the Sino-Indian border to the reefs of the South China Sea to the ultimate flashpoint of Taiwan are simply glossed over with anodyne references to ‘rules-based approaches’ and ‘integrated deterrence’”. In Goldstein’s view, the IPSUS’ RBA to resolving those geostrategic flashpoints mentioned in the Indo-Pacific Strategy, are likely to be dull and ineffectual and are not likely to bring any degree of resolution to the disputants. This is so, since the treatment under the RBA is likely to be too covertly brief to be informative.

Let’s start with the issue of arming the police. After the tensions, for a long time Solomon police did not carry arms but this is an exception in our history. Indeed, the precursor of the Royal Solomon Islands Police Force (RSIPF) created during the early colonial era was known as the ‘BSIP Armed Constabulary’. For as long as I can remember, our police have had access to some form of arms stored in the armoury. Their use traditionally was ceremonial, mostly during parades. In fact, many of us who used to watch their parades loved to hear the sound made when the police and marine units lifted the guns as they responded to the orders of the parade commander. The only time the weapons were used in my lifetime was during the Bougainville crisis and during the ethnic tensions.

PORT VILA, VANUATU (22 February 2022): After a lengthy process, the MSG Secretariat has a new Director General, he is Mr. Leonard Louma OBE from Papua New Guinea. This follows an announcement by the Chairman of the MSG and Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Honourable James Marape in an Official Statement issued on the 1st of February 2022 in Port Moresby. The MSG Secretariat was without a Director General since the departure of former Director General, Ambassador Amena Yauvoli of Fiji who served the Secretariat from 2016 – 2020.

The Official statement of appointment was delivered on behalf of the four MSG Leaders including, Honourable Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama MP, Prime Minister of the Republic of Fiji, Honourable Manasseh Sogavare MP, Prime Minister of Solomon Islands, Honourable Bob Lougman Weibur MP, Prime Minister of the Republic of Vanuatu; and Mr Victor Tutugoro Spokesperson of the FLNKS.

Prime Minister Marape stated that the appointment of Mr Leonard Louma was a result of a lengthy and rigorous merit-based process of appointing a new Director General.  He reiterated that the process of recruitment of the new Director General was done in accordance to the agreed policy process of recruiting a new Director General which was adopted at the 20th Leaders’ Summit in Honiara, Solomon Islands on 26 June 2015. The Process is based on a merit-recruitment system that allows for a best candidate to be appointed. 

In compliance with the agreed stipulated policy, a Recruitment Committee comprising of Members (PNG, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu), also called the TROIKA did a thorough screening of applicants, shortlisting and interviewing of the shortlisted candidates.  The TROIKA from its interviews and assessment concluded and recommended in their report the appointment of Mr Leonard Louma as first choice. In the event that that he declines then the offer can be given to the alternative next best preferred candidate. The recommendation as contained in the TROIKA report was considered by the MSG Senior Officials Meeting (SOM) and duly endorsed out-of-session by the MSG Foreign Ministers Meeting (FMM).

The MSG Chair further officially requested for his MSG Colleague Leaders to consider and approve out-of-session the appointment of the new Director General in December 2021. And having received no objection from his colleague MSG Leaders when the due date for consideration had lapsed, he proceeded with the necessary preparations to make the formal announcement of the appointment. 

Prime Minister Marape in his statement stated that, he is satisfied and confident that due process had been complied with and that his announcement of the appointment of the new Director General is in order and in the best interest of the MSG Group.
While he conveyed his appreciation to his colleagues, the MSG Leaders, for their continuous support and confidence rendered to him as the MSG Chair, he reiterated the fact that the MSG Secretariat has been without a substantive Director General for 1 year and 10 months and has been the longest since the establishment of the Secretariat. Therefore, the appointment of the Director General is a necessity and a matter of urgency for the Group.

Prime Minister James Marape on behalf of the MSG Leaders, in congratulating the newly appointed Director General, Mr Leonard Louma stated that he has confidence in him to continue to lift the visions, spirit and solidarity of the MSG and moreover to lead the MSG Secretariat into new heights.

Mr Leonard Louma OBE who hails from Milne Bay Province in Papua New Guinea is a former seasoned diplomat and a senior public servant who had more than 30 years of senior management experience in both the government and private sector.  Mr Louma has served in the Papua New Guinea Permanent Mission to the United Nations in New York (USA) and the Papua New Guinea Embassies in Paris (France) and Beijing (China). He was responsible for opening the PNG Embassy in Paris as Charge D’Affaires and was Papua New Guinea’s roving Ambassador to APEC, ASEAN, ESCAP and concurrently PNG High Commissioner to Singapore. 

Additionally, nationally he had served as head of several departments within the Papua New Guinea Department of Foreign Affairs and the Office of the Prime Minister. In the latter, he served as Special Advisor on International Relations, Foreign Policy and Foreign Affairs matters to the Prime Minister and subsequently as Chief of Staff to the late Prime Minister Grand Chief Sir Michael Somare from 2005 – 2011. 

Regionally, he has been involved in the development and implementation of many regional initiatives such as the original Pacific Plan and its successor in the Framework for Pacific Regionalism, MSG’s 2038 Prosperity for all Plan as a member of an Eminent Person, The MSG Trade Agreement, Re-enlistment of New Caledonia on the UN list of Non Self Governing Territories, the development and negotiation (truncated)",,,,6,-6.5

In the month of May and April, MHMS received two COVID-19 testing machines called the qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction) machines, each donated by the People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the Australian Government. Both machines have been pre-calibrated by their manufacturing companies prior to sending them over to the Solomon Islands and have passed quality control checks at the National Referral Hospital (NRH) Molecular Lab. Following the testing carried out at the NRH Molecular lab; both machines have satisfied internal and external quality controls provided by Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory (VIDRL) in Australia. Selected samples sent to VIDRL for validation and quality assurance confirms the quality assurance standards requirement. As such, both machines have fulfilled quality assurance requirements. Repatriates during May were tested using both machines as part of the quarantine protocol including suspected cases, with most of the tests performed using China donated qPCR machine since the machine has 3000 test kits available to be used with. Both machines however require another type of kit called extraction kit to perform their tasks. Extraction kits procured from Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) which should have also accompanied the (BGI) qPCR donated by the PRC embassy could not be found as such an alternative extraction kit that was available called “pure link” was used instead with China donated qPCR. Quality checks conducted showed acceptable results. While MHMS is working closely with the relevant partner to locate the missing extraction kits, it had recently procured 1000 extraction kits that arrived on the 26th of June 2020. Additional 300 kits have also been donated by the Government of New Zealand, which arrived on 29 June 2020. MHMS will continue to ensure that both qPCR machines have the necessary accessories to continue conducting COVID-19 tests. The release of all 178 May repatriates in just two weeks is enough evidence of both machines as operational. If the machines have technical, calibration, and language issues, the molecular laboratory at NRH would not be able to conduct any COVID-19 test. In the Pacific only Fiji, New Caledonia, Guam, and recently the Solomon Islands perform COVID-19 tests with the qPCR machine. WHO rates qPCR machines as one of the most sensitive and accurate methods for detecting, tracking, and studying COVID-19. These machines have been the primary method for confirming COVID-19 cases globally. On this note, MHMS would like to assure everyone not to panic nor worry, as all the passengers scheduled to arrive this week will undergo COVID-19 testing both for any suspects and to fulfill the quarantine protocols before released to reunite with their families. MHMS continues to remain grateful to its donors and partners for their assistance in the country’s efforts to remain COVID-19 free and more especially for the capabilities to detect presence of COVID-19 and capacity building to contain and control possible entry and outbreak of COVID-19 in the country. Solomon Islands continue to be among the only 12 countries in the world to date that maintains a COVID-19 free status and in order for us to keep it that way, it requires solidarity, unity, and combined efforts from everyone. This is the only and the most effective way forward to come out of this pandemic triumphantly.

VOREQE BAINIMARAMA ON COVID-19 (15/05/20)

Bula vinaka. 
 
Back on the 18th of April, we clinically confirmed our 18th case of COVID-19. This was in the midst of our response to the devastation of severe Cyclone Harold, which had ripped across our islands the week prior, levelling homes and flooding communities.
 
With two national disasters threatening the lives of Fijians at once, Fiji was faced with a dilemma the likes of which we’d never seen. We declared two simultaneous States of Natural Disaster, kicking off a month-long, whole-of-government campaign to assist those in the path of the storm’s wrath without compromising any of our life-saving progress in our war against the coronavirus.

By adapting our cyclone response to the reality of COVID-19, we’ve saved lives on the frontlines of both existential threats. Even as Fijians evacuated their communities and authorities dispatched to badly-hit regions during TC Harold, not a single case of coronavirus was spread as a result of the storm. And this week, following these achievements, these States of Natural Disaster have not been extended. 
 
If no new cases are recorded tomorrow, that will mark four full weeks without a new case of COVID-19. The experts tell us those 28 days represent two full incubation periods for the coronavirus. That means that over this period, if the virus was passed to any close contacts of our existing patients, our tests would confirm it. Even as we’ve continued to conduct over 1,000 more tests over these four weeks, every morning, every one of those tests has come back negative. On top of that victory, we’re also confirming our 15th full recovery of the virus, meaning only three active cases remain. 
 
Fiji is now well on our way to eliminating COVID-19 entirely, and we’re one of the few nations on Earth who can make that claim. Our progress has come not from fortune, but through foresight; every step taken was swift, every decision made was decisive, and every success we’ve recorded has been well-earned. 
 
But much as this feels like a moment of celebration –– as it should –– the end of these declarations does not mean Fiji is entirely rid of this virus. We still have Fijians in government funded quarantine facilities who could yet develop the disease. As tight as our safety nets maybe –– there is always a chance that an asymptomatic case has slipped through undetected. We have no evidence to suggest this is the case, but it is still a risk we must consider, because all it takes is one case, one super-spreader, to provoke a Fijian epidemic of COVID-19. 
 
From the beginning, we’ve armed ourselves with only the best available medical information. As the medical community’s knowledge of this virus has evolved, so has our response. It would be easy for me to stand here today and declare total victory over this virus. It would be easy to say this war has been completely won and roll-back every health protection directive in one fell-swoop. But we can never settle for “easy” with a virus this devastating and unpredictable. We have no choice but to continue treating this invisible enemy with deadly seriousness. 

As I speak, China is already seeing a second wave of infections and Europe is bracing for the same. We cannot risk a second wave of Fijian infections; that is why, for the time being, all of our health protection directives will remain in full effect. 

The nationwide curfew will remain in effect from 10 pm until 5 am every day. Social gatherings must be limited to 20 people or fewer. Gyms, nightclubs, cinemas and swimming pools will remain closed, as will houses of worship. Contact sports are still not allowed to be played. Our schools will remain closed as well until the 12th of June 2020.  Existing quarantine protocols will remain in place, including for Fijians returning overseas. These repatriating Fijians will immediately enter 14 days of quarantine in government funded facilities. At the end of the 14 day period, if they test negative for the virus, they can complete their remaining 14 days of self-quarantine at home.

In the coming weeks, we will finalise our game plan for a gradual scale-back of some of these measures. But I want to be crystal clear with every person watching: No matter how confident we are that this virus has been defeated, our most critical restrictions aren’t going anywhere. The good habits that we’ve picked up over the past few months –– physical distancing, regular handwashing, staying home or wearing face masks when we’re sick, not sharing takis and bilos, and keeping a clean working environment –– must become new ways of Fijian life. We cannot risk falling back into life-risking bad habits. To keep Fiji healthy, and to prevent a dangerous second wave of the virus, these new healthy habits must stick. 
 
And even as we explore ways we can safely scale back restrictions, we’re also stepping up our virus containment. We’ve already health (truncated)",,,,5,-7.2

This week, the U.S. signed memorandums of understanding with the Marshall Islands and Palau that administration officials hope will pave the way for the quick completion of broader agreements that will govern the islands’ relations with Washington for the next two decades. Those ties grant the U.S. unique military and other security rights on the islands in return for substantial aid.

The Kiribati government has been waging a campaign against the country’s judiciary after attempting to prevent High Court judge David Lambourne​ – the husband of the country’s opposition leader – from entering the country, and trying to set an end-date to his term as a judge. New Zealand judges appear to have been caught in the crossfire. The country’s chief justice, Bill Hastings, a New Zealand appointee, was suspended in July after ruling in favour of Lambourne. Hastings has faced a tribunal reviewing unspecified claims of misconduct. Three retired New Zealand judges working for Kiribati’s appeals court Peter Blanchard​, Rodney Hansen​, KC, and Paul Heath, were suspended in September after also ruling in favour of Lambourne. NZ’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade has confirmed the three will also face a tribunal. The suspension of all but the country’s magistrates court has come as Kiribati has shunned relations with Pacific neighbours and the United States while building its relationship with China. Kiribati removed itself from the Pacific Islands Forum earlier this year, and did not attend a Pacific summit at the White House last week.

Discussions in five years have failed to see an agreement on the prohibition of wire leads and shark lines on fishing vessels. That means the critically endangered Oceanic White Tip and near-threatened Silky Shark will spend another 12 months facing lines and wires which mean near certain death. Bubba Cook of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) said the consensus-bases process of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission was an issue of concern in shark conservation. ""One of the problems with the process is that it only takes one member to veto an action,"" Cook said. ""We think it's simply absurd not to adopt the measures (to protect sharks) in total."" New Caledonia and French Polynesia have supported moves to revise fishing measures to protect sharks. China, which has one of the world's largest fishing fleets, has not stated its position.

Political gridlock had left the U.S. unable to join the UN’s Convention on the Law of the Sea, implemented by the International Seabed Authority (ISA), retired U.S. Commander Kirk Lippold told Washington think tank ,the Wilson Centre, this week. on Wednesday. “It is unfortunate that we are living in an era where politics is beginning to drive everything, even to the detriment of our national security,” he said. China is already a member of the convention, along with 167 other member countries, including Australia.

The negotiations stalled after these first discussions were held in Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia between President Trump’s Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and RMI President Hilda Heine, and leaders of the FSM and Palau in early August 2019. The following year, the COVID pandemic hit, both Trump and Heine were voted out of office, and new administrations in Washington and Majuro took over.

An annual study released by Australia’s Lowy Institute on Monday showed financial assistance to the Pacific Islands rose 47 percent in 2020 versus the year before. Lead researcher Alexandre Dayant told AFP that “there was a massive increase in loans”. Total financing soared to $4.2 billion (US$2.6 billion) — the highest figure on record and roughly equivalent to Fiji’s gross domestic product. Much of the spending splurge was driven by crisis as tourism and trade-dependent islands across the region suffered with countries closing their borders to keep out the virus. “The Pacific was facing massive, massive support needs, they were facing massive economic contraction,” Dayant said. https://bit.ly/3sLVkS4:=:https://islandsbusiness.com/news-break/pacific-aid-surges-as-china-u-s-vie-for-influence/ #aid #fiji #solomonislands #vanuatu",https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=539700498163449&set=a.493450552788444&type=3,,,,,,,,3,-10.33

BY TAVAKE SIMON HANA’AROA

BY establishing the craft market center in the Art Gallery compound in Honiara for local artists, vendors including craftsmen and women as an avenue to sell their indigenous, artistic and creative products are still seen as not enough for the majority of them.

They often described the issues of selling and marketing their products to their potential customers as an unfilled gap or unresolved dilemma.

“We have all that is needed like the skills and knowledge to create the arts and crafts and as well the venue to sell our products, however marketing is still an obstacle for most of us,” according to local craftsman and artist, Michael Kaura.

Michael Kaura said marketing and promotion are all they needed to help them sell their products.

He said the media is the right platform that would help them to market and promote those indigenous, artistic and creative products out there.

“We need support from the media to help us promote our products on whatever platforms – whether its newspaper or radio or even online.

“We sincerely ask the ministry to see our struggle and help us to market us out there.

“We have the artistic skill, but we lack exposure, thus we need to work closely with the media for that purpose,” Michael Kaura said.

According to the United Nation World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), it says the media have a crucial role to play to help market its destination and boost the local economy.

“The relationship between tourism and the media is vital and complex.

“Tourism is highly dependent on media reporting because the vast majority of travel decisions are made by people who have never seen the destination first hand for themselves,” according to UNWTO.

Owner of Imperial Travel Service Solomon Islands Ender Rence in light with that has hit hard on the media to seriously put more effort into reporting tourism.

“Media industry should be the breath and life of tourism in the Solomon Islands.

“Marketing and advertising of tourism come through the media.

“To promote our success stories of tourism, we need the media,” Ender Rence said.

Brian Afia Curator of the National Art Gallery also said work is underway with Information Communication Technology (ICT) on creating links purposely to promote local products to overseas markets.

“That is good news for the artists and vendors.

“We are working closely with ICT on creating some links that would help our local artists to promote their products in it or if there should any marketing agency that would want to promote our local arts, they would just tap the link,” Curator Brian Afia said.

However, local artists thanked the government through the ministry of foreign affairs and the Republic of China, Taiwan (ROC) for the facility.

In addition, for the first time in a decade, the government will do what it promised to do in the 2013 election and index aid, though unfortunately the 2.5% increase applied to “base” aid, that is excluding the temporary measures, will not keep up with resurgent inflation. Together, however, these two measures – partial indexation and an increase in temporary aid – will result in a small nominal increase and a stabilisation of aid in real terms in 2022-23.

(GOVT. PRESS SECRETARIAT); The Ministry of Health have confirmed that a couple, a Samoan woman and her Kenyan husband, are now under quarantine at Faleolo Health Clinic as part of the precautionary measure set up by the Ministry to protect Samoa from Coronavirus.

The travellers were in China for business and transited through Fiji for 10 days.  The Ministry explained that the couple did not satisfy the self-quarantine protocol, hence why they have been detained for review.  

The latest Health Travel Advisory states that all travelers from Mainland China, must spend at least 14 days self-quarantine at country of last port that is free of the 2019 Novel Coronavirus and must undergo medical clearance within (3) days prior to final route to Samoa.

Since the enforcement of the travel restrictions, 6 travellers have been put under quarantine with 18 passengers being denied entry into Samoa.

It was maddening making this video when time and time again I would get ace sorties but I cant use the kill footage because they lost control after taking damage as opposed to what you see in the video.<br>Oh how I envy those with high quality microphones able to make commentaries on their exploits! I really desire to perforate my action videos with some personality. Some of the things I play need some kind of context behind them and often my microphone prevents me from releasing content from these games, like Wargame Red Dragon. Though I'm unsure how my subscribers would receive me I feel the need to branch out.<br>One of the major reasons I use text and captions and why I make montages in the first place is because I'm insecure of my microphone. Make no mistake I'm happy to splatter my personality and voice all over my videos and yet I don't have the means. The reason it took a week to release another video is because I had to scrap a Wargames Red Dragon commentary that I just couldn't work around the obvious mic issues... <br>I'm trying my best with my warthunder videos but I am constantly frustrated by the lack of consistent quality and although my editing skills have improved I can't seem to get the quality of footage I desire. This is compounded by glaring issues in warthunder's replay system.<br>Perhaps I should focus on the funny meta of the game like with my Yak-9 video.<br>Perhaps I should make a longer Arma video Dyslexi style.<br>Perhaps I'm being too hard on myself haha! <br>What do you think I should make next?<br>Reddit: http://www.reddit.com/r/Warthunder/comments/2c2h4v/juggernaut_p47d28/<br>Music: I'd Like them Dead (Elysium OST)",2014-07-29T15:03:01,37788,46,604,0,200

The Alpha unit targeted Amin, and the Zenith unit had the task of collecting factual evidence that Amin was collaborating with the United States. Both units were brought to Afghanistan secretly and blended with Muslim battalions to make an impression that the operation was carried out by locals, whereas in reality nearly all work was done by Alpha and Zenith.<br>Before the operation, Balashov surveyed the area under the guise of a bodyguard of a Soviet diplomat. His unit knew that they were going to a death zone and felt uncomfortable about it – about 80% of them were wounded shortly after they left their vehicles, yet they continued the assault. As Balashov expected, Amin's troops targeted the first and last vehicle in the convoy of six. He placed his team of five men in the front BMP and, when the BMP got immobilized by fire from Amin's troops, ordered them to abandon the BMP and run to the palace. All five were quickly wounded by massive fire from the guards, but were saved by bulletproof vests and helmets.<br>This account generally agrees with that by Lyakhovskiy, who gives more details and accentuates the ferocity and professionalism on both the attacking and defending sides.<br>Music:<br>Michael McCann Behavior - Okhotsk<br>Le Gang Des Ours - INTERLUDE<br>Also consider funding my next projects: https://www.patreon.com/Oxide1<br>Discord: https://discord.gg/FKNpTQC<br>Shirts: https://www.redbubble.com/people/Smertnosny/explore?asc=u&page=1&sortOrder=recent<br>Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/oxideyt/?hl=en<br>Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/OxideYT<br>https://www.facebook.com/RushingRussians<br>https://grey-shop.ru/ Code: Benj7<br>https://www.dealairsoftinnovations.com/<br>https://kruschiki.com/ Code: oxide<br>https://www.pkpatchworks.com/ Code: OXIDE",2020-04-13T20:39:15,419145,771,15030,0,200
